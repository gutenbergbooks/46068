<h2 class="p4">Preface</h2>

<p class="pn p2">Abbotsford merits a volume in the present
series will be readily conceded. In preparing the
letterpress I have found myself, not unnaturally,
playing to some extent the part of a biographer, and
in this I have generally followed Lockhart, always
the ultimate authority on Sir Walter. A number
of fresh facts, however, will be found here and there
throughout the work. Mrs. Maxwell Scott has
kindly read the proof of 'The Later Abbotsford,'
and for the 'Treasures' chapter I am indebted
somewhat to her admirable little 'Catalogue,' which
no visitor to Scott's home should miss.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">INTRODUCTORY</p>


<p class="pn p2">Last year (1904) no fewer than seven thousand
persons from all parts of the world visited Abbotsford.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
There is no diminution in the annual pilgrimage
to this chief shrine of the Border Country,
nor is there likely to be. Scott's name, and that
of Abbotsford, are secure enough in the affections
of men everywhere. Whilst many would rejoice to
see Sir Walter's home on a different footing from a
patriotic point of view&mdash;less of a shilling show-house
for one thing&mdash;there is no reason to quarrel with the
present arrangements, which, likely enough, are the
best under existing conditions. The order of viewing
the various rooms, however, might well be
improved, the public permitted to linger over them
a little more leisurely, and also to see something
of the exterior of the building. That many ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Scott worshippers who flock yearly to Abbotsford
would welcome a more ample opportunity for study
and reflection within its charmed enclosure goes
without saying. Of course, as being still a private
residence, there are obvious difficulties in the way
of such easier access. But probably that may come
by-and-by.</p>

<p>The best preparation for a visit to Abbotsford is
a course of Lockhart. There is no more faithful
account of the place, from its purchase to the high-water
mark of Scott's happiness there and the
troubled years preceding the end. From at least
1820, and irrespective of his London life, Lockhart
was Scott's companion and confidant at Abbotsford.
Seldom has the fellowship of letters shown a friendship
so strong and true. It was sympathy other
than that of a son-in-law which Lockhart brought
to the writing of his great Biography, and which
has made it one of the masterpieces of literature.
Never, surely, was a great man more fortunate in
his life-story than Scott at the hands of Lockhart,
one of the most maligned and misunderstood men
of his day, indeed, but a kindly, lovable soul withal.
To understand Abbotsford, it is a necessity that one
should study the life of its originator and owner,
with whose name, notwithstanding any subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
occupation, the 'romance in stone and lime' is
indissolubly connected.</p>

<p class="b1">In Scott's earliest association with Abbotsford,
or, rather, with the site on which Abbotsford stands,
is there not theme alike for painter and poet?
Lockhart tells how Scott used to relate that,
travelling in boyhood with his father from Selkirk
to Melrose, the old man desired the carriage to
halt at the foot of an eminence, and said: 'We
must get out here, Walter, and see a thing
quite in your line.' His father then conducted
him to a rude stone<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on the edge of an acclivity
about half a mile from the Tweed, at which spot
the last great clan-battle of the Borders was
fought between Scotts and Kers for the possession
of King James V., the young Prince himself
being a spectator of the contest. From a child
Scott had exhibited a marked precocity for Border
history and Border lore in general, and even
then, as a boy, there were few to excel him as
a story-teller. The printed page was in the dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
distance, but already he could command an audience
no less wonder-struck with that fair silver tongue of
his, which in the budding Edinburgh days won him
the heart of Mrs. Alison Cockburn and her coterie.
We may be sure that the elder Walter had a
more than average pride in the boy's tastes and
promise for the future, nor would the opportunity
be lacking by which these were encouraged and
enriched. The road between Selkirk and Melrose
has other memories, recalled, doubtless, that day
as they drove along, but to a boy whose mind
seemed ever bent on</p>

<p class="ppq20">'Old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
And battles long ago,'</p>

<p class="p1 b1">the near neighbourhood of a Border battle-field was
quite an event. Hence the picture of Scott and
his father surveying the spot where, in the year
1526,</p>

<p class="ppi15">
'gallant Cessford's heart-blood dear<br />
Reeked on dark Elliot's Border spear,'</p>

<p class="p1">might well lend inspiration for some artist's canvas.
For there is more in the subject than the mere
suggestion of a future great author touching for
the first time the land to be immortalized by his
genius. Were it that only, we should have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
endless succession of canvases; but it is the
suggestiveness of strongest personal association
rather. Comparatively few recollect the incident
which appealed so to Scott, both in his boyhood
and later life. But everybody knows that practically
all the arena of that fateful struggle&mdash;most of
the landscape on which his youthful vision long
and rapturously rested&mdash;by-and-by became his
own possession. We may suppose that at least a
quarter of a century lay between that day and the
purchase of his first hundred acres as Laird of
Abbotsford, and the gradual growth, almost year
by year, of the lands of Abbotsford, still holds a big
place in the popular imagination. As a battle
scene, it was significant of his own career. What
conquests were these fields not again to witness&mdash;and
what defeats! What heroism of the pen, no less
noble than that of the sword! What determination
in the face of fearful odds to do his best at Duty's call,
no less honoured and no less magnificent in achievement
than the doughtiest deed of arms in ancient
or modern days! That Abbotsford should attract
its tens of thousands from all ends of the earth was
to be expected after such a strenuous life as Scott's.
Human nature must always pay homage at the
shrine of the truly great, and if it be true that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
writer has given pleasure to vaster multitudes, and
that never has the life of his country been so well
limned as by this master-hand, it will be equally
true of Abbotsford that it will never want those
to whom everything about it and its very dust
is dear.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">FROM CARTLEYHOLE TO ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is scarcely necessary to recall that Scott on both
sides of his house was connected with the Border
Country&mdash;the 'bold bad Border' of a day happily
long dead. He would have been a reiver himself,
more than likely, and one of its nameless bards to
boot, had he lived before the Border felt the subdued
spirit of modern times. In the many-sided
story of the Border, however, with its rare wealth
of romanticism, Scott found his life-work. So that
it was the Border which made him the force he is
in the world of letters. No Borderer&mdash;no Scotsman,
indeed, has taken truer and firmer hold of his
countrymen. A descendant of Wat of Harden,
linked to the best blood of the Border, and with
every phase of his life redolent of the Border
feeling, history has had no difficulty in claiming
Sir Walter Scott as the most representative Border
man the world has seen. He was not born in the
Border Country, but practically all his life was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
spent there. His environment throughout was that
of a Borderer. He belongs, to be sure, to every
country. Like Shakespeare and Burns, Scott is
one of the cosmopolitan heroes of literature, whose
works are as widely cherished abroad as at home.
Not a summer in the Border Country&mdash;the true
'Scott Country'&mdash;but is evidence of his universality.
Scott gloried in the heritage that came
to him from generations of Border ancestors,
their cattle-lifting propensities notwithstanding.
To belong to the Border&mdash;to Tweedside, to use his
pet phrase&mdash;was never a superficial boast. It was
because his most personal interests were bound up
therein, and because he clung with a whole-hearted
passion to the Border and to the Tweed, that these
are to-day the most familiar of Scottish names.
'It is part of my creed,' he writes in an early letter
to Patrick Murray, 'that the Tweed and Teviot
yield to none in the world; nor do I fear that even
in your eyes, which have been feasted on classic
ground, they will greatly sink in comparison with
the Tiber or Po!' Calais was not more indelible on
Mary's heart than the Tweed was on Scott's. All the
joyful strength of his life, says Ruskin, was spent in
the Tweed valley. He came to the Border a
sickly, delicate child, between his third and fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
year, and for threescore years and one he seldom
left it for any lengthened interval. Edinburgh was
his school, and his office, and the arena of much of
his professional career. At a later period it was
crowded with many painful memories. But he was
happiest, even amid the most crushing sorrows of
his life, when within earshot of the Tweed. There
was not a blither or sunnier boyhood than Scott's at
Rosebank, where even then he was 'making' himself,
and dreaming of the days that were to be. At
Ashestiel, the birthplace of the most popular poetry
of the century before Byron blazed upon the
literary horizon, his life was singularly untrammelled.
Ashestiel, from being off the beaten track
perhaps, seems to have lost favour somewhat with
the Scott student. At any rate, it is not the
shrine it should be, although in several respects it
is more interesting to lovers of Scott than even
Abbotsford itself. As for Abbotsford, may we not
say that it is at once the proudest, and the most
stimulating, and the saddest memorial ever associated
with a man of letters? All these, comprising
the three periods of Scott's life&mdash;Rosebank,
Ashestiel, Abbotsford&mdash;lie as close to the Tweed
as can be&mdash;none of them more than a few hundred
paces from it at the outset. And when the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Borderer's task was accomplished, where more fitly
could he have rested than with the river of his
love and of his dreams singing ceaseless requiem
around his last low bed?</p>

<p>It will be interesting to have a glimpse of
Tweedside just as Scott appeared upon the scene.
Since his day the valley in many of its aspects
has not been without change. Even the remote
uplands, long untouched by outside influences, have
not escaped the modern spirit. The river must
needs remain <i>in statu quo</i>, but the contrast between
Sir Walter's Tweedside and ours is considerable.
A century of commerce and agriculture has wrought
marvels on the once bare and featureless and uncultivated
banks of the Tweed. And none would
have rejoiced at its present picturesque and prosperous
condition more than Scott himself. Of the
valley as it was a hundred years since, some early
travellers give their impressions. There is the
following from a Londoner's point of view, for
instance&mdash;a somewhat sombre picture, true enough,
however, of <i>the upper reaches</i> at the time: 'About
four in the afternoon we were obliged to proceed
on our journey to Moffat, a market town, where
we were informed we should meet with good
lodging, which made us ride on the more briskly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
but notwithstanding all our speed, we had such
terrible stony ways and tedious miles, that when
we thought we had been near the place, we met
a Scotchman, who told us we were not got half
way; this put us almost into the spleen, for we
could see nothing about us but barren mountains
on the right and the River Tweed on the left,
which, running thro' the stones and rocks with
a terrible noise, seemed to us like the croaking
of a Raven, or the tone of a Screitch Owle
to a dying man, so we were forced to ride on
by guesse, knowing not a step of the way, and
meeting none to direct us, till at last, coming up
a hill, we spyed some waggons going over another
mountain before us, and resolving to press somebody
into our service, we rode on as fast as we could to
overtake them, and then we were told we had still
twelve long miles to Moffat.'</p>

<p>Dorothy Wordsworth's diary (1803) of a day by
the Tweed below Peebles&mdash;<i>the middle portion</i> of
the stream&mdash;is a pleasanter memory: 'We had a
day's journey before us along the banks of the
Tweed, a name which has been sweet to my ears
almost as far back as I can remember. After the
first mile or two our road was seldom far from the
river, which flowed in gentleness, though perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
never silent; the hills on either side high, and
sometimes stony, but excellent pasture for sheep....
In one very sweet part of the vale a gate crossed
the road, which was opened by an old woman who
lived in a cottage close to it. I said to her, "You
live in a very pretty place!" "Yes," she replied,
"the water of Tweed is a bonny water." The
lines of the hills are flowing and beautiful, the
reaches of the vale long; in some places appear the
remains of a forest, in others you will see as lovely
a combination of forms as any traveller who goes
in search of the picturesque need desire, and yet
perhaps without a single tree; or, at least, if trees
there are, they shall be very few.' And writing
about the same time the Rev. Richard Warner&mdash;afterwards
the author of a work on the Waverley
Novels&mdash;describes <i>the lower half</i> of the river between
Berwick and Kelso: 'The country around Berwick,
though swelling into hills and sinking into vales, has
neither beauty nor variety, the one being uniform
and lumpish, the other wide and unwooded. A
naked surface everywhere presents itself, unadorned
with those indispensable features in agreeable landscape,
lofty trees and spreading shrubs. The river
Tweed, also, disappointed our expectations of
picturesque beauty. Associated as the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
this river had hitherto been in our minds with
poetical and pastoral ideas, we were prepared to
admire its fringed banks and sacred shades, the
haunt of many a water-nymph and sylvan deity;
but alas! no solemn woods lifted their lofty heads
over these celebrated waters. All was original
nakedness.... The scenery is more animated
and cheerful in the neighbourhood of Kelso, where
wood is more frequent. Tweed's velvet banks
were here and there spotted with little clumps of
trees, presenting a fairer subject for tender and
elegiac poetry than it had before done.'</p>

<p>At Scott's day the Tweed valley, in what are
now its most luxuriant reaches, exhibited a markedly
naked and treeless character. From Abbotsford
to Norham Castle the scenery was of the openest.
Here and there 'ancestral oaks' still clumped
themselves about the great houses, with perhaps
some further attempt at decorating the landscape.
But that was rare enough. Landlords had not
learned the art, not to speak of the wisdom,
of tree-planting. It is only within the past hundred
years that planting has become frequent, and the
modern beauty of Tweedside emerged into being.
It is said that Scott was one of the first to popularize
the planting spirit. His operations at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Abbotsford certainly induced the neighbouring
proprietors to follow suit. Scott of Gala, and the
lairds of Ravenswood, Drygrange, Cowdenknowes,
Gladswood, Bemersyde, Mertoun, Eildon Hall, and
Floors, all took their lead, more or less, from Abbotsford.
Arboriculture was Scott's most passionate
hobby. At least two long articles were penned by
him on the subject, and he practised the art with
extraordinary diligence and foresight. Of botany
he knew little, but of trees everything. As we shall
see, not the least important part of Abbotsford's
creation was planning and perfecting that wondrous
wealth of woodland&mdash;a very network about
the place, on whose full growth his eyes, alas! were
not destined to feast. 'Somebody,' he said, 'will
look at them, however, though I question that they
will have the same pleasure in gazing on the full-grown
oaks that I have had in nursing the saplings.'</p>

<p>A fourth impression of Tweedside comes to us
from the pages of Lockhart. We are dealing
now with <i>the site of Abbotsford</i> as it was about
the year 1811. Scott was tenant of Ashestiel.
Here he had spent eight of the pleasantest years
of his life. But his lease was out, and the laird
himself&mdash;his cousin, General Russell&mdash;was returning
from India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>In casting about for a new abode, Scott seems
at first to have thought of Broadmeadows, on the
Yarrow, then in the market, a compact little
domain which would have suited him well. Lockhart's
one regret was that Scott did not purchase
Broadmeadows. Here, surrounded by large landed
proprietors, instead of a few bonnet-lairds, he would
certainly have escaped the Abbotsford 'yerd-hunger,'
and changed, possibly, the whole of his career. But
the Broadmeadows Scott might have been very different
from <i>our Sir Walter</i>. Of Newark, also, close
by, the scene of the 'Lay,' he had some fancy, and
would fain have fitted it up as a residence. The
ancestral home of Harden itself was proposed to him,
and indeed offered, and he would have removed
thither but for its inconvenience for shrieval duties.
After all, however, there was uppermost in Scott's
mind the wish to have a house and land of his
own&mdash;to be 'laird of the cairn and the scaur,' as in
the case of Broadmeadows, or 'a Tweedside laird'
at best, and later on, perhaps, to 'play the grand old
feudal lord again.' Lockhart assures us that Scott
was really aiming at higher game. His ambition was
to found a new Border family, and to become head
of a new branch of the Scotts, already so dominant.
And did he not succeed? It is not strictly true to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
say that he failed. He realized his ambition, and
he died in that belief. He built his 'castle,' as he
playfully calls it, with more grandeur about it than
he had, mayhap, dreamed of. Honours of the
highest were heaped upon him. And at his death,
at any rate, there was a prospect of his line being
continued. Only one ugly shadow stood between&mdash;his
monetary troubles. It is easy to say at this
time of day that Scott was defeated in his most
cherished hopes. He was defeated, as hundreds
are, through the accidents of history. But in
himself he was surely a noble success, and at his
passing most of his plans had prospered. Scott
towered so much above his fellows in intellectual
strength, and he had such perfect faith in himself
and the power of his own transcendent capabilities,
that it is scarcely fair to pass censure on the ambitions
and ideals which governed him, and the steady
purpose that made him one of the truest and best
of men&mdash;one of the world's greatest men. There
is no occasion to bemoan Scott's career, no need to
reflect on its 'might-have-beens.' His course he
had mapped out for himself, and it was the only
course destined to give us Scott as he wished to
be, and as the generations should best remember
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>About to quit Ashestiel, therefore, his attention
was directed to a small farm-holding not far
distant, on the south bank of the Tweed, some
two miles from Galashiels, and about three from
Melrose. Scott knew the spot well. It had 'long
been one of peculiar interest for him,' from the
incident mentioned in the foregoing chapter. By
name Newarthaugh&mdash;a name almost forgotten in
the story of Abbotsford&mdash;it was also known as
Cartleyhole, or Cartlawhole, and Cartlihole, according
to the Melrose Session Records, in which parish
it was situated. The place was tenanted for a time
by Taits and Dicksons. Then it seems to have
passed into the family of Walter Turnbull, schoolmaster
of Melrose, who disposed of it, in the year
1797, to Dr. Robert Douglas, the enterprising
and philanthropic minister of Galashiels. Why
Dr. Douglas purchased this property nobody has
been able to understand. It lay outside his parish,
and was never regarded as a desirable or dignified
possession. A shrewd man of business, however,
he may, like Scott, have judged it capable of results,
speculating accordingly. He had never lived at
Cartleyhole. The place was laid out in parks, and
the house, of which, curiously, Scott speaks in a
recently recovered letter as 'new and substantial,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was in occupation. The surroundings were certainly
in a deplorably neglected condition. The
sole attempt at embellishment had been limited to
a strip of firs so long and so narrow that Scott
likened it to a black hair-comb. 'The farm,' according
to Lockhart, 'consisted of a rich meadow or
haugh along the banks of the river, and about a
hundred acres of undulated ground behind, all in
a neglected state, undrained, wretchedly enclosed,
much of it covered with nothing better than the
native heath. The farm-house itself was small and
poor, with a common kailyard on one flank and
a staring barn on the other; while in front appeared
a filthy pond covered with ducks and duckweed,
from which the whole tenement had derived the
unharmonious designation of Clarty Hole.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A
local reminiscence emphasizes Lockhart's description:
'The first time I saw Cartley Hole, or, as it
is more appropriately called, Clarty Hole, which
you are probably aware is the Scotch term for
dirty, was in 1807 or 1808. I was on my first
holiday visit to an uncle in Darnick. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
low-built, one-story house, standing in what was
literally a <i>hole</i>, and it had anything but a prepossessing
appearance. It may have had attics,
but of this I am not quite sure. It had nothing
to recommend it as a site for a stately mansion,
save its proximity to the Tweed. The scenery
around was bare, and did not boast of a single
natural beauty.' But to Scott's far-seeing eye
matters were not so hopeless. There were, he felt,
possibilities in the place. Moreover, it was his wish
to <i>create</i>, as far as he could, the home that was to be
his own. Cartleyhole offered in many respects an
ideal site for the purpose he had in prospect. It
lay at almost the centre of the Border district.
All around were the grand historic and romantic
associations of the Border, the subjects in which
Scott revelled. Melrose Abbey, the most graceful
and picturesque ruin in Scotland, already so celebrated
in his verse, was visible from many points in
the neighbourhood. Dryburgh was not far distant.
Yonder Eildon's triple height, sacred to so much
of the supernatural in Border lore, reared his grey
crown to the skies. There, the Tweed, 'a beautiful
river even here,' flowed in front, broad and bright
over a bed of milk-white pebbles. Selkirk, his
Sheriff's headquarters, was within easy reach. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was interested in the Catrail, or Picts' Work Ditch,
on the opposite hillside, so often alluded to in his
letters to Ellis; and on his own ground were fields,
and mounds, and standing-stones, whose placenames
recalled the struggle of 1526. A Roman
road running down from the Eildons to a ford on
the Tweed, long used by the Abbots, the erstwhile
lords of the locality, furnished a new designation
for the acres of hungry haugh-land&mdash;'as poor and
bare as Sir John Falstaff's regiment'&mdash;upon which
was destined to be reared the most venerated, and
probably the most visited shrine in the kingdom.</p>

Was never scene so sad and fair!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn p2 b1">On May 12, 1811, we find Scott writing to
James Ballantyne: 'I have resolved to purchase a
piece of ground sufficient for a cottage and a few
fields. There are two pieces, either of which would
suit me, but both would make a very desirable
property indeed, and could be had for between
£7,000 and £8,000&mdash;or either separate for about
half the sum. I have serious thoughts of one or
both, and must have recourse to my pen to make
the matter easy.' By the end of June one of the
pieces passed into his hands for the sum mentioned&mdash;£4,000,
half of which, according to Scott's bad
and sanguine habit, he borrowed from his brother
John, raising the remainder on the security of
'Rokeby,' as yet unwritten. The letter to Dr.
Douglas acknowledging his receipt for the last instalment
of the purchase-money has been preserved:
'I received the discharged bill safe, which puts an
end to our relation of debtor and creditor:</p>

<p class="ppq30">'Now the gowd's thine,<br />
And the land's mine.</p>

<p class="pn p1">I am glad you have been satisfied with my manner
of transacting business, and have equal reason at
least to thank you for your kindly accommodation
as to time and manner of payment. In short, I
hope our temporary connection forms a happy contradiction
to the proverb, "I lent my money to my
friend; I lost my money and my friend." A figure
of note in his day, Dr. Douglas was born at the
manse of Kenmore, in 1747, and in his twenty-third
year was presented to the parish of Galashiels,
where he laboured till his death in 1820. He has
been styled the Father of Galashiels. Much of his
money&mdash;he inherited a fortune from his brother,
a Captain in the Indian Army&mdash;was lent without
stint to the manufacturers of that period, who
were struggling out of their old-time condition as
country weavers, and endeavouring to establish the
woollen trade as a staple industry in the town.
Galashiels, when Abbotsford came into being, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a mere thatched hamlet. Then it could boast of
not more than a dozen slated houses. To-day
there is a population of over 13,000. Dr. Douglas's
friendship with Scott continued for many years.
He was the 'reverend and unbigoted' clergyman
to whom Scott addressed 'Paul's Letter' on
Religion in France, and was himself the author
of a carefully compiled essay on 'Agriculture in
the Counties of Roxburgh and Selkirk.' Perhaps
most interesting to recall, it was to Dr. Douglas
that Mrs. Cockburn of Fairnalee penned her epistle
wherein mention is made of Scott in his seventh
year as 'the most extraordinary genius of a boy
I ever saw.' Four-and-thirty years lay between
that evening and the purchase of Cartleyhole&mdash;'a
poor thing, but mine own.' Scott had taken a
further, and as yet the most important, step up
the ladder of his ambition. Things were going
well with him, and it was a joy to send such
welcome news to his brother-in-law on the other
side of the world:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> 'This is the greatest incident
which has lately taken place in our domestic concerns,
and I assure you we are not a little proud of
being greeted as Laird and Lady of Abbotsford.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a><br /><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE CREATION OF ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">The first purchase of land was close on a hundred
and ten acres, half of which were to be planted,
and the remainder kept in pasture and tillage.
An ornamental cottage with a pillared porch&mdash;a
print of which is still preserved&mdash;after the style
of an English vicarage, was agreed upon, and it
was here that Scott passed the first years of his
Abbotsford life. He had many correspondents
during this period. Daniel Terry, an architect
turned actor, was probably his chief adviser as
to Abbotsford and its furnishings, no end of letters
passing between them. Morritt of Rokeby was
much in his confidence, and Joanna Baillie, 'our
immortal Joanna,' whose 'Family Legend,' had
been produced at Edinburgh the previous year
under Scott's auspices. The plans for his house
were at first of the simplest. He thus describes
them to Miss Baillie: 'My dreams about my
cottage go on. My present intention is to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
only two spare bedrooms, with dressing-rooms,
each of which on a pinch will have a couch-bed;
but I cannot relinquish my Border principle of
accommodating all the cousins and <i>duniwastles</i>, who
will rather sleep on chairs, and on the floor, and in
the hayloft, than be absent when folks are gathered
together.'</p>

<p>To Morritt we find him writing: 'I have fixed
only two points respecting my intended cottage&mdash;one
is that it shall be <i>in</i> my garden, or rather
kailyard; the other, that the little drawing-room
shall open into a little conservatory, in which conservatory
there shall be a fountain. These are
articles of taste which I have long since determined
upon; but I hope before a stone of my paradise is
begun we shall meet and collogue upon it'; but
soon after, as an excuse for beginning 'Rokeby,'
his fourth verse romance, he says: 'I want to build
my cottage a little better than my limited finances
will permit out of my ordinary income.' Later on he
tells Lord Byron that 'he is labouring to contradict
an old proverb, and make a silk purse out of a sow's
ear&mdash;namely, to convert a bare haugh and brae
into a comfortable farm'; and to Sarah Smith, a
London tragic actress, he writes: 'Everybody,
after abusing me for buying the ugliest place on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Tweedside, begins now to come over to my side.
I think it will be pretty six or seven years hence,
whoever may come to see and enjoy, for the sweep
of the river is a very fine one of almost a mile in
length, and the ground is very unequal, and therefore
well adapted for showing off trees.' Scott,
as was said, took a profound interest in tree-planting.
Had he not been able to add by purchase
the neighbouring hills to his original lands, it was
said that he would have requested permission of the
owners to plant the grounds, for the mere pleasure
of the occupation, and to beautify the landscape.
'I saunter about,' he said to Lady Abercorn, 'from
nine in the morning till five at night with a plaid
about my shoulders and an immense bloodhound
at my heels, and stick in sprigs which are to become
trees when I shall have no eyes to look at them!
He had a painter's as well as a poet's eye for
scenery: 'You can have no idea of the exquisite
delight of a planter,' he said; 'he is like a painter
laying on his colours&mdash;at every moment he sees his
effects coming out. There is no art or occupation
comparable to this; it is full of past, present, and
future enjoyment. I look back to the time
when there was not a tree here, only bare heath; I
look round and see thousands of trees growing up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
all of which&mdash;I may say almost each of which&mdash;have
received my personal attention. I remember five
years ago looking forward, with the most delighted
expectation, to this very hour, and as each year has
passed the expectation has gone on increasing. I
do the same now; I anticipate what this plantation
and that one will presently be, if only taken care of,
and there is not a spot of which I do not watch the
progress. Unlike building, or even painting, or
indeed any other kind of pursuit, this has no end,
and is never interrupted, but goes on from day to
day and from year to year with a perpetually
augmenting interest. Farming I hate; what have
I to do with fattening and killing beasts, or raising
corn only to cut it down, and to wrangle with
farmers about prices, and to be constantly at the
mercy of the seasons? There can be no such
disappointments or annoyances in planting trees.'</p>

<p>Scott left Ashestiel at Whitsunday, 1812&mdash;a
rather comical 'flitting,' according to his own
account of it. 'The neighbours,' he writes to
Lady Alvanley, 'have been much delighted with
the procession of my furniture, in which old
swords, bows, targets, and lances made a very conspicuous
show. A family of turkeys was accommodated
within the helmet of some <i>preux</i> chevalier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of ancient Border fame; and the very cows, for
aught I know, were bearing banners and muskets.
I assure your ladyship that this caravan, attended
by a dozen of ragged, rosy peasant children, carrying
fishing-rods and spears, and leading ponies,
greyhounds, and spaniels, would, as it crossed the
Tweed, have furnished no bad subject for the
pencil, and really reminded me of one of the gypsy
groups of Callot upon their march.' The year
1812 was one of his busiest. Five days every
week until the middle of July he did Court duty
at Edinburgh. Saturday evening saw him at
Abbotsford. On Monday he superintended the
licking into shape of his new domicile, and at night
he was coaching it to the city. During the Court
recess he pegged away at 'Rokeby' and other
work under circumstances that must have been
trying enough. 'As for the house and the poem,'
he writes to Morritt, 'there are twelve masons
hammering at the one and one poor noddle at
the other.' He did not then know the luxury
of a private 'den' as at Castle Street. A window
corner, curtained off in the one habitable room
which served for dining-room, drawing-room, and
school-room, constituted his earliest Abbotsford
study. There, amid the hammer's incessant fall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and the hum of many voices, and constant interruptions,
he plodded on, and got through a fair
amount. The letters to Terry commence in September,
1812, and show that some little progress
had been made: 'We have got up a good garden-wall,
complete stables in the haugh, and the old
farm-yard enclosed with a wall, with some little
picturesque additions in front. The new plantations
have thriven amazingly well, the acorns are
coming up fast, and Tom Purdie is the happiest
and most consequential person in the world.' To
Joanna Baillie he sends this characteristic note,
in the beginning of 1813: 'No sooner had I
corrected the last sheet of 'Rokeby' than I escaped
to this Patmos as blithe as bird on tree, and have
been ever since most decidedly idle&mdash;that is to say
with busy idleness. I have been banking, and
securing, and dyking against the river, and planting
willows, and aspens, and weeping birches. I
have now laid the foundations of a famous background
of copse, with pendent trees in front; and
I have only to beg a few years to see how my
colours will come out of the canvas. Alas! who
can promise that? But somebody will take my
place&mdash;and enjoy them, whether I do or no'; and
in March he adds: 'What I shall finally make of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
this villa work I don't know, but in the meantime
it is very entertaining'; and again: 'This little
place comes on as fast as can be reasonably
hoped.' To Lady Louisa Stuart he writes: 'We
are realizing the nursery tale of the man and his
wife who lived in a vinegar bottle, for our only
sitting-room is just 12 feet square, and my
Eve alleges that I am too big for our paradise.'
In October, 1813, Terry is told that 'these are no
times for building,' but in the following spring,
pressing the Morritts to visit him, he says: 'I
am arranging this cottage a little more conveniently,
to put off the plague and expense of
building another year, and I assure you I expect
to spare you and Mrs. Morritt a chamber in the
wall, with a dressing-room and everything handsome
about you. You will not stipulate, of course,
for many square feet.' In a letter to Terry, dated
November 10, 1814&mdash;the year of 'Waverley'&mdash;further
progress is reported: 'I wish you saw
Abbotsford, which begins this season to look the
whimsical, gay, odd cabin that we had chalked out.
I have been obliged to relinquish Stark's (the
Edinburgh architect, who died before the building
was well begun) plan, which was greatly too
expensive. So I have made the old farm-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
my <i>corps de logis</i> with some outlying places
for kitchen, laundry, and two spare bedrooms,
which run along the east wall of the farmcourt,
not without some picturesque effect. A
perforated cross, the spoils of the old kirk of
Galashiels, decorates an advanced door, and looks
very well.' Not much was done during the next
two years, but in November, 1816, a new set of
improvements was under consideration. Abbotsford
was rapidly losing its cottage character. The
'romance' period was begun. A notable addition&mdash;connecting
the farm-house with the line of buildings
on the right&mdash;was then agreed upon, on which
Scott communicates with Terry: 'Bullock<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> will
show you the plan, which I think is very ingenious,
and Blore has drawn me a very handsome
elevation, both to the road and to the river.
This addition will give me a handsome boudoir
opening into the little drawing-room, and on the
other side to a handsome dining-parlour of 27
feet by 18, with three windows to the north
and one to the south, the last to be Gothic
and filled with stained glass. Besides these commodities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
there is a small conservatory, and a study
for myself, which we design to fit up with ornaments
from Melrose Abbey.' In the same letter
he says: 'I expect to get some decorations from
the old Tolbooth of Edinburgh, particularly the
copestones of the doorway, and a niche or two.
Better get a niche <i>from</i> the Tolbooth than a niche
<i>in</i> it to which such building operations are apt to
bring the projectors.'</p>

<p>By July, 1817, the foundation of the existing
house, which extends from the hall westwards to
the original courtyard, had been laid, and Scott
found a new source of constant occupation in
watching the proceedings of his masons. In consequence
of a blunder or two during his absence,
'I perceive the necessity,' he said, 'of remaining
at the helm.' To Joanna Baillie he writes in
September: 'I get on with my labours here; my
house is about to be roofed in, and a comical
concern it is.' There is some correspondence in
October between Scott and Terry relative to the
tower, a leading feature of the building. Scott
mentions that (Sir) David Wilkie, who had just
been his guest, 'admires the whole as a composition,
and that is high authority.' 'I agree with
you that the tower will look rather rich for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
rest of the building, yet you may be assured that,
with diagonal chimneys and notched gables, it
will have a very fine effect, and is in Scotch
architecture by no means incompatible.' In the
beginning of 1818, he again writes to Terry: 'I
am now anxious to complete Abbotsford. I have
reason to be proud of the finishing of my castle,
for even of the tower, for which I trembled, not
a stone has been shaken by the late terrific gale
which blew a roof clean off in the neighbourhood.'
Lockhart, who saw Abbotsford for the first time in
1818, confesses that the building presented a somewhat
'fantastic appearance,' the new and old by
no means harmonizing (see the chapter on Lockhart
for a further account of his visit). In the spring
of 1820 Scott writes to his wife from London,
whither he had gone to receive his baronetcy: 'I
have got a delightful plan for the addition at
Abbotsford, which, I think, will make it quite
complete, and furnish me with a handsome library,
and you with a drawing-room and better bedroom.
It will cost me a little hard work to meet the
expense, but I have been a good while idle.' The
plans for these new buildings, including the wall
and gateway of the courtyard and the graceful
stone screen which divides it from the garden,
were made by Blore, although the screen&mdash;with
its carvings taken from details of stone-work at
Melrose Abbey&mdash;was originally devised by Sir
Walter himself. During the winter of 1821 the
new operations were commenced. By the spring
of 1822 they were in full swing. 'It is worth
while to come,' he writes to Lord Montagu, 'were
it but to see what a romance of a house I am
making'; and to Terry later on: 'The new castle
is now roofing, and looks superb&mdash;in fact, a little
too good for the estate; but we must work the
harder to make the land suitable.' That same
summer the place was besieged by visitors from
the South, who, after witnessing the King's reception
at Edinburgh, hastened out to see Abbotsford.
In October, 1822, he writes to his son Walter: 'My
new house is quite finished as to masonry, and we
are now getting on the roof just in time to face the
bad weather.' In November, 1822, and January,
1823, there are long letters to Terry: 'The house
is completely roofed. I never saw anything handsomer
than the grouping of towers, chimneys, etc.,
when seen at a proper distance.' With Terry all sorts
of subjects were discussed&mdash;bells, and a projected
gas installation, along with a constant enumeration
of curios and relics, on which he is urged to spare
no expense. 'About July,' Scott writes at the
beginning of 1824, 'Abbotsford will, I think, be
finished, when I shall, like the old Duke of Queensberry
who built Drumlanrig, fold up the accounts
in a sealed parcel, with a label bidding "the deil
pike out the een" of any of my successors that
shall open it.' By Christmas, it was completed,
and with the New Year's festivities a large and gay
party celebrated the 'house-warming,' of which
Basil Hall's sprightly 'Journal,' incorporated in the
'Life,' supplies a singularly agreeable account. But
there is no room to quote. It was a doubly joyous
occasion, marking not only the realization of Scott's
long-cherished scheme as to his 'castle,' but the
engagement of his eldest son, with whom, as he
must have felt at the time, were the fortunes
of the future Abbotsford. Of the year entered
so auspiciously, none dreamt what the end was
to be.</p>

<p class="pn p2">In the creation of Abbotsford not only was the
cottage of 1812 transformed to the castle of 1824,
but the estate itself was continually enlarging.
Possession of land was a crowning passion with
Scott. He was always driving bargains, as he
declared&mdash;on the wrong side of his purse, however&mdash;with
the needy, greedy cock-lairds of the locality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
'It rounds off the property so handsomely,' he
says in one of his letters. Once, on his friend
Ferguson remarking that he had paid what appeared
to be one of his usual fabulous prices for a particular
stretch, Scott answered quite good-humouredly,
'Well, well, it is only to me the scribbling of
another volume more of nonsense.' The first purchase
was, as we have seen, the hundred odd
acres of Clarty Hole. In 1813 he made his second
purchase, which consisted of the hilly tract stretching
from the Roman road near Turn-Again towards
Cauldshiels Loch, then a desolate and naked
mountain mere. To have this at one end of his
property as a contrast to the Tweed at the other
'was a prospect for which hardly any sacrifice
would have appeared too much.' It cost him
about £4,000. In 1815, Kaeside&mdash;Laidlaw's home&mdash;on
the heights between Abbotsford and Melrose,
passed into his hands for another £4,000, and
more than doubled the domain. The house has
changed considerably since Laidlaw's halcyon days.
By 1816 the estate had grown to about 1,000 acres.
In 1816 and 1817 he paid £16,000 for the two
Toftfields, altering the name of the new and
unfinished mansion to Huntlyburn, from a supposed
but absolutely erroneous association with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the 'Huntlee Bankis'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the Thomas the Rhymer
romance. In 1820, Burnfoot, afterwards Chiefswood,
and Harleyburn fell to his hands for £2,300, and
there were many minor purchases of which Lockhart
takes no notice. Scott was very anxious to
acquire the estate of Faldonside,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> adjoining Abbotsford
to the west, and actually offered £30,000 for
it, but without success. He was similarly unsuccessful
with Darnick Tower, which lay into his
lands on the east, and which he was extremely
desirous of including in Abbotsford. Scott's
suggestion rather spurred the owner, John Heiton,
to restore the ancient peel-house as a retreat for
his own declining days, and it is still in excellent
preservation&mdash;one of the best-preserved peels on
the Border&mdash;and a veritable museum, crammed
from floor to ceiling with curios, relics, and
mementos both of the past and present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn p2">But even 'yerd-hunger' must be satisfied, and in
Scott's case there was nothing for it save to steel
the flesh against further desire. In November,
1825, there is the following entry in his diary:
'Abbotsford is all I can make it, so I resolve on no
more building and no purchases of land till times
are quite safe.' But times were never safe again.
Abbotsford was all but within sound of the
'muffled drum.' Very soon&mdash;December 18, 1825&mdash;Scott
was to write these words: 'Sad hearts at
Darnick and in the cottages of Abbotsford. I
have half resolved never to see the place again.
How could I tread my hall with such a diminished
crest! How live a poor, indebted man where I was
once the wealthy, the honoured!' And again on
January 26, 1826: 'I have walked my last on the
domains I have planted, sat the last time in the
halls I have built'&mdash;reflections happily unrealized,
though, as a matter of fact, Scott was then the
laird of Abbotsford in name only, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>The building and furnishing of Abbotsford are
estimated to have cost over £25,000. The contract
for the 1824 edifice was in the capable hands of
the Smiths of Darnick, with whom Scott was on
the most cordial terms. John Smith (the sculptor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the Wallace statue at Bemersyde) was a singularly
able craftsman, and his staff of workmen, with
Adam Paterson for foreman, were known all over
the Border. For the interior decorations&mdash;painting,
papering, etc., and even for some of the
carvings and casts&mdash;Scott generally gave employment
to local labour. Much of the costlier furniture
was shipped from London, but the great bulk
of the work was carried through by tradesmen in
the district, selected by Scott himself, and in whom
he placed implicit confidence. The estate, all told,
must have cost at least £60,000. It extended to
1,500 acres, and the annual rental in Scott's day
was only about £350.</p>

<p>Such was the creation of Scott's Abbotsford, a
real 'romance in stone and lime,' to use the
Frenchman's hackneyed phrase. Never had Sir
Walter deeper delight than when its walls were
rising skywards, and the dream of his youth taking
steady shape by the silvery side of the Tweed.
But for Abbotsford he would not have been <i>our</i>
Scott&mdash;our man among men&mdash;our Immortal. If
Abbotsford was his dream, it was also his Delilah.
It is at once a reminder of his success, and of the
most gigantic literary collapse of the century. So
far as monuments to Scott go, there is none to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
equal it, not even the most splendid and costly pile
which is one of Edinburgh's proudest adornments.
Yet of all his creations, Abbotsford will be the
soonest to perish, for 'Waverley' and its fellows
are imperishable. Still, so long as it lasts, it will
be the memorial of a pride, unjustifiable in many
respects, but chivalrous withal, and of a fall to
depths seldom touched, but., best of all, of a restoration
than which there has been none more illustrious&mdash;none
more heroic in literary craftsmanship. 'I
have seen much, but nothing like my ain house,'
he cried&mdash;a broken, dying man returned to Abbotsford,
only to be borne forth again. Nor has history
been slow to add its Amen.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">SCOTT AT ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">Of the Abbotsford life in the seven or eight
brilliant seasons preceding the disaster of 1826
Lockhart's exquisite word-pictures are far the
finest things in the Biography. Scott's dream
was now fairly realized. He was not only a lord
of acres, but a kind of mediæval chieftain as well.
His cottage was transformed to a superb mansion,
like some creation of the 'Arabian Nights,'
and the whole estate, acquired at a cost far
exceeding its real value, had grown to one of
the trimmest and snuggest on Tweedside. A
comparative failure at the Bar, Scott succeeded
well otherwise in his professional career. His
income from the Court Clerkship and Sheriffdom
totalled £1,600, and from other sources he had an
additional £400 a year. As the most prosperous
book-producer of the period, he was netting an
annual profit of no less than £10,000. His family
was grown up, and his home life, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
some harsh things said about Lady Scott, was of
the happiest. Unliterary, and Frenchified to a
degree, Charlotte Carpenter was not the ideal
helpmeet, perhaps, for a man of Scott's calibre
and temperament. But that they lived comfortably
together, that she made him an excellent
wife, and that Scott was much attached to her,
must be taken for granted, else Lockhart and the
others are equivocating. There is at least one
glimpse into Scott's heart which cannot savour
of hypocrisy&mdash;the occasion of her death. Some of
the most touching passages in the Diary belong
to that event. As lover, husband, father, there
is no question of the acuteness with which he
felt her loss who had been his 'thirty years'
companion.' Within less than six months the
two biggest blows of his life fell upon Scott.
Ruined, then widowed, his cup of grief was
drained to the utmost. But before the fatal '26
Scott's life was an eminently ideal one. Abbotsford
was all he could make it. He had reached
the loftiest rung of the ladder. Long had he been
the celebrity of the hour, not in Britain only, but
throughout Europe itself. Probably no British
author of his time was more widely known, and
none, it is certain, was surrounded with so many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the material comforts. It was truly a summer fulness
for Scott at Abbotsford ere the autumn winds
or the biting breath of winter had begun to chill his
cheek.</p>

<p class="b1">A glance at the Abbotsford life will bring us
nearer Scott as a man&mdash;and as the most lovable
of men. Treading, as one does to-day, in his very
footsteps, we shall want to know how he lived there,
and in what manner the pleasant days were spent.
Scott's habits at Abbotsford, as at Ashestiel, were
delightfully simple. In the country he was a
rustic of the rustics. Formality vanished to a
considerable extent when he changed his town-house
for the bracing atmosphere of the Tweed.
But always methodical in his literary operations,
he never allowed the freer life of Abbotsford
to interfere with whatever tasks he had on
hand. He did not sit late into the night. As
a rule, the Abbotsford day ended for Scott by
ten o'clock. He rose at five, lit his own fire in
the season, shaving and dressing with precision.
Attired generally in his green shooting-jacket, he
was at his desk by six, and hard at work till nine.
About half-past nine, when the family met for
breakfast, he would enter the room 'rubbing his
hands for glee,' for by that time he had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
enough, as he said, 'to break the neck of the day's
work.' After breakfast, he allowed his guests to fill
in the next couple of hours or so for themselves&mdash;fishing,
shooting, driving, or riding, with a retinue
of keepers and grooms at command. Meantime
he was busy with his correspondence, or a chapter
for Ballantyne to be dispatched by the 'Blucher,'
the Edinburgh and Melrose coach, by which he
himself frequently travelled to and from Abbotsford.
At noon he was 'his own man,' and among his
visitors, or felling trees with the workmen on the
estate, laying wagers, and competing with the
best of them. When the weather was wet and
stormy he kept to his study for several hours during
the day, that he might have a reserve fund to draw
from on good days. To his visitors he appeared
more the man of leisure than the indefatigable
author conferring pleasure on thousands. Only
a careful husbanding of the moments could have
enabled him to give the greater part of afternoon
and evening to his guests. 'I know,' said Cadell,
the publisher, once to him, 'that you contrive to
get a few hours in your own room, and that may
do for the mere pen-work, but when is it that you
think?' 'Oh,' said Scott, 'I lie simmering over
things for an hour or so before I get up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
there's the time I am dressing to overhaul my
half-sleeping, half-waking <i>projet de chapitre</i>, and
when I get the paper before me it commonly runs
off pretty easily. Besides, I often take a dose in
the plantations, and while Tom marks out a dyke
or a drain as I have directed, one's fancy may be
running its ain riggs in some other world.' His
maxim was never to be doing nothing, and in
making the most of the opportunities, he served
both himself and his friends. Several of Lockhart's
reminiscences of the Abbotsford life are so
delightfully vivid, conveying probably better than
anything else something of the ideal charm of
Scott and his circle, that the following may well
be printed in full:</p>

<p class="pbq">'I remember saying to (Sir) William Allan one
morning, as the whole party mustered before the
porch after breakfast, "A faithful sketch of what
you at this moment see would be more interesting
a hundred years hence than the grandest so-called
historical picture that you will ever exhibit in
Somerset House"; and my friend agreed with
me so cordially that I often wondered afterwards
he had not attempted to realize the suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The subject ought, however, to have been treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
conjointly by him (or Wilkie) and Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p class="p1">'It was a clear, bright September morning, with
a sharpness in the air that doubled the animating
influence of the sunshine, and all was in readiness
for a grand coursing match on Newark Hill. The
only guest who had chalked out other sport for
himself was the staunchest of anglers, Mr. Rose;
but he, too, was there on his <i>shelty</i>, armed with
his salmon-rod and landing-net, and attended by
his humorous squire, Hinves, and Charlie Purdie,
a brother of Tom, in those days the most celebrated
fisherman of the district. This little group of
Waltonians, bound for Lord Somerville's preserve,
remained lounging about to witness the start of
the main cavalcade. Sir Walter, mounted on
Sybil, was marshalling the order of procession
with a huge hunting-whip; and among a dozen
frolicsome youths and maidens, who seemed disposed
to laugh at all discipline, appeared, each on
horseback, each as eager as the youngest sportsman
in the troop, Sir Humphry Davy, Dr. Wollaston,
and the patriarch of Scottish belles-lettres, Henry
Mackenzie. The Man of Feeling, however, was
persuaded with some difficulty to resign his steed
for the present to his faithful negro follower, and
to join Lady Scott in the sociable, until we should
reach the ground of our battue. Laidlaw, on a
long-tailed, wiry Highlander, yclept Hoddin Grey,
which carried him nimbly and stoutly, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his feet almost touched the ground as he sat,
was the adjutant. But the most picturesque
figure was the illustrious inventor of the safety-lamp.
He had come for his favourite sport of
angling, and had been practising it successfully
with Rose, his travelling companion, for two or
three days preceding this, but he had not prepared
for coursing fields, and had left Charlie Purdie's
troop for Sir Walter's on a sudden thought; and
his fisherman's costume&mdash;a brown hat with flexible
brim, surrounded with line upon line, and innumerable
fly-hooks, jack-boots worthy of a Dutch
smuggler, and a fustian surtout dabbled with the
blood of salmon&mdash;made a fine contrast with the
smart jackets, white-cord breeches, and well-polished
jockey-boots of the less distinguished
cavaliers about him. Dr. Wollaston was in
black, and, with his noble, serene dignity of
countenance, might have passed for a sporting
archbishop. Mr. Mackenzie, at this time in the
seventy-sixth year of his age, with a white hat
turned up with green, green spectacles, green
jacket, and long brown leathern gaiters buttoned
upon his nether anatomy, wore a dog-whistle
round his neck, and had all over the air of as
resolute a devotee as the gay Captain of Huntlyburn.
Tom Purdie and his subalterns had preceded
us by a few hours with all the greyhounds that
could be collected at Abbotsford, Darnick, and
Melrose; but the giant Maida had remained as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his master's orderly, and now gambolled about
Sybil Grey, barking for mere joy, like a spaniel
puppy.</p>

<p class="b1">'The order of march had been all settled, and
the sociable was just getting under weigh, when
<i>the Lady Anne</i> broke from the line, screaming
with laughter, and exclaimed, "Papa! papa! I
knew you could never think of going without your
pet." Scott looked round, and I rather think there
was a blush as well as a smile upon his face, when
he perceived a little black pig frisking about his
pony, and evidently a self-elected addition to the
party of the day. He tried to look stern, and
cracked his whip at the creature, but was in a
moment obliged to join in the general cheers.
Poor piggy soon found a strap round his neck, and
was dragged into the background. Scott, watching
the retreat, repeated with mock pathos the first
verse of an old pastoral song:</p>

<p class="ppiq25">'What will I do gin my hoggie die?<br />
My joy, my pride, my hoggie!</p>
<p class="ppi25">My only beast, I had nae mae,<br />
And wow! but I was vogie!'</p>

<p class="p1">The cheers were redoubled, and the squadron
moved on. This pig had taken, nobody could tell
how, a most sentimental attachment to Scott, and
was constantly urging its pretension to be admitted
a regular member of his <i>tail</i>, along with the greyhounds
and terriers; but, indeed, I remember him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
suffering another summer under the same sort of
pertinacity on the part of an affectionate hen. I
leave the explanation for philosophers; but such
were the facts. I have too much respect for the
vulgarly calumniated donkey to name him in the
same category of pets with the pig and the hen;
but, a year or two after this time, my wife used to
drive a couple of these animals in a little garden
chair, and whenever her father appeared at the
door of our cottage, we were sure to see Hannah
More and Lady Morgan (as Anne Scott had
wickedly christened them) trotting from their
pasture to lay their noses over the paling, and,
as Washington Irving says of the old white-haired
hedger with the Parisian snuff-box, "to have a
pleasant crack with the laird."'</p>

<p class="p2">The Abbotsford Hunt, another of the great
annual outings&mdash;a coursing match on an extensive
scale&mdash;affords material for Lockhart's best vein,
especially the Hunt dinner, which for many of the
neighbouring yeomen and farmers was <i>the</i> event
of the year. 'The company were seldom under
thirty in number, and sometimes they exceeded
forty. The feast was such as suited the occasion&mdash;a
baron of beef, roasted, at the foot of the
table, a salted round at the head, while tureens of
hare-soup, hotchpotch, and cockieleekie extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
down the centre, and such light articles as geese,
turkeys, an entire sucking-pig, a singed sheep's
head, and the unfailing haggis were set forth by
way of side-dishes. Black-cock and moor-fowl,
snipe, black and white puddings, and pyramids of
pancakes, formed the second course. Ale was the
favourite beverage during dinner, but there was
plenty of port and sherry for those whose stomachs
they suited. The quaighs of Glenlivet were filled
brimful, and tossed off as if they held water. The
wine decanters made a few rounds of the table,
but the hints for hot punch and toddy soon became
clamorous. Two or three bowls were introduced
and placed under the supervision of experienced
manufacturers&mdash;one of these being usually the
Ettrick Shepherd&mdash;and then the business of the
evening commenced in good earnest. The faces
shone and glowed like those at Camacho's wedding;
the chairman told his richest stories of old rural
life, Lowland or Highland; Ferguson and humbler
heroes fought their Peninsular battles o'er again;
the stalwart Dandie Dinmonts lugged out their last
winter's snow-storm, the parish scandal, perhaps, or
the dexterous bargain of the Northumberland tryst.
Every man was knocked down for the song that
he sung best, or took most pleasure in singing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Shortreed gave "Dick o' the Cow," or "Now
Liddesdale has ridden a raid"; his son Thomas
shone without a rival in the "Douglas Tragedy"
and the "Twa Corbies"; a weather-beaten, stiff-bearded
veteran, "Captain" Ormiston, had the
primitive pastoral of "Cowdenknowes" in sweet
perfection. Hogg produced the "Women Folk,"
or "The Kye comes Hame," and, in spite of many
grinding notes, contrived to make everybody
delighted, whether with the fun or the pathos of
his ballad. The Melrose doctor sang in spirited
style some of Moore's masterpieces. A couple of
retired sailors joined in "Bold Admiral Duncan,"
and the gallant croupier crowned the last bowl
with "Ale, good ale, thou art my darling." And
so it proceeded until some worthy, who had fifteen
or twenty miles to ride, began to insinuate that
his wife and bairns would be getting sorely anxious
about the fords, and the Dumples and Hoddins
were at last heard neighing at the gate, and it was
voted that the hour had come for <i>doch an dorrach</i>,
the stirrup-cup, a bumper all round of the unmitigated
mountain dew. How they all contrived
to get home in safety Heaven only knows,
but I never heard of any serious accident except
upon one occasion, when James Hogg made a bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
at starting that he would leap over his wall-eyed
pony as she stood, and broke his nose in this
experiment of o'ervaulting ambition. One comely
good-wife, far off among the hills, amused Sir
Walter by telling him the next time he passed her
homestead after one of these jolly doings, what
her husband's first words were when he alighted at
his own door&mdash;"Ailie, my woman, I'm ready for
my bed; and oh, lass, I wish I could sleep for a
towmont, for there's only ae thing in this warld
worth living for, and that's the Abbotsford Hunt."'</p>

<p class="b1">Nor was the good old custom of the Kirn
omitted at Abbotsford. Every autumn, before
proceeding to Edinburgh, Scott gave a 'Harvest
Home,' to which all the tenantry and their friends&mdash;as
many as the barn could hold&mdash;were invited.
Sir Walter and his family were present during the
first part of the evening, to dispense the good things
and say a few words of farewell. Old and young
danced from sunset to sunrise, to the skirling of John
o' Skye's pipes, or the strains of some 'Wandering
Willie's' fiddle, the laird having his private joke for
every old wife or 'gausie carle,' his arch compliment
for the ear of every bonnie lass, and his
hand and his blessing for the head of every little
Eppie Daidle from Abbotstown or Broomielees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Hogmanay, and the immemorial customs of the
New Year, as celebrated in Scotland&mdash;now fast
dying out&mdash;obtained full respect at Abbotsford.
Scott said it was uncanny, and would certainly
have felt it very uncomfortable not to welcome the
New Year in the midst of his family and a few
cronies in the orthodox fashion. But nothing
gave him such delight as the visit which he
received as laird from all the children on his estate
on the last morning of the year, when, as he was
fond of quoting:</p>

<p class="ppq20">'The cottage bairns sing blythe and gay<br />
At the ha' door for hogmanay.'</p>

<p class="p1">'Yesterday (December 31, 1825) being Hogmanay,'
says Basil Hall's 'Journal'&mdash;the clearest,
cleverest, most picturesque sketch of the Abbotsford
life from an outsider's point of view&mdash;'there
was a constant succession of guizards&mdash;boys dressed
up in fantastic caps, with their shirts over their
jackets, and with wooden swords in their hands.
These players acted a sort of scene before us, of
which the hero was one Goloshin, who gets killed
in a battle for love, but is presently brought to
life again by a doctor of the party. As may be
imagined, the taste of our host is to keep up these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
old ceremonies. Thus, in the morning, I observed
crowds of boys and girls coming to the back-door,
where each got a penny and an oaten-cake. No
less than seventy pennies were thus distributed&mdash;and
very happy the little bodies looked with their
well-stored bags.' Guizarding&mdash;that is, masquerading,
guising&mdash;has lost practically all the scope and
popularity it once had in the South of Scotland.
The present writer well remembers how, as a boy,
he took part scores of times during Christmas and
New Year weeks in the grotesque but picturesque
play referred to. The words and form of the drama
exist in various versions in every part of the Border
Country, almost every parish possessing its own
rendering. The <i>dramatis personæ</i>, three or four in
number, sometimes five, arrayed in the fashion
described above, proceeded from house to house,
generally contenting themselves with the kitchen
for an arena, where the performance was carried
through in presence of the entire household.
Galations (not Goloshin) is the title of the play.
Some account of it will be found in Chambers'
'Popular Rhymes of Scotland' and in Maidment's
scarce pamphlet on the subject (1835).</p>

<p class="b1">From what has been said, it is not difficult to
imagine the ideal relationship existing between Scott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and his dependents at Abbotsford. They were
surely the happiest retainers and domestics in the
world. How considerate he was in the matter of
dwellings, for instance! He realized that he owed
them a distinct duty in diffusing as much comfort
and security into their lives as possible. They were
not mere goods and chattels, but beings of flesh and
blood, with human sympathies like himself. And
he treated them as such. Amid the severities of
winter, some of his Edinburgh notes to Laidlaw are
perfect little gems of their kind: 'This dreadful
weather will probably stop Mercer (the weekly
carrier). It makes me shiver in the midst of superfluous
comforts to think of the distress of others. I
wish you to distribute £10 amongst our poorer neighbours
so as may best aid them. I mean not only the
actually indigent, but those who are, in our phrase,
<i>ill off</i>. I am sure Dr. Scott (of Darnlee) will assist
you with his advice in this labour of love. I think
part of the wood-money, too, should be given
among the Abbotstown folks if the storm keeps
them off work, as is like.' And again: 'If you can
devise any means by which hands can be beneficially
employed at Abbotsford, I could turn £50 or
£100 extra into service. If it made the poor and
industrious people a little easier, I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
more pleasure in it than any money I ever spent in
my life.' 'I think of my rooks amongst this snow-storm,
also of the birds, and not a little of the
poor. For benefit of the former, I hope Peggy
throws out the crumbs, and a cornsheaf or two for
the game, if placed where poachers could not come
at them. For the poor people I wish you to
distribute £5 or so among the neighbouring poor
who may be in distress, and see that our own folks
are tolerably well off.' 'Do not let the poor bodies
want for a £5, or even a £10, more or less'&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq20">'We'll get a blessing wi' the lave,<br />
And never miss 't.'</p>

<p class="p1">Socially, the bond between Scott and his servants
was a characteristic object-lesson. 'He speaks to
us,' said one, 'as if we were blood relations.' Like
Swift, he maintained that an affectionate and faithful
servant should always be considered in the
character of a humble friend. Even the household
domestics 'stayed on' year after year. Some
of them grew grey in his service. One or two
died. He had always several pensioners beside
him. Abbotsford was like a little happy world of
its own&mdash;the most emphatic exception to the cynic's
rule. Scott was 'a hero and a gentleman' to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
who knew him most intimately in the common and
disillusionizing routine of domestic life.</p>

<p class="b1">In reading Lockhart, one feels that, aristocrat as
Scott was, familiar with the nobility and literary
lions of the time, he was most at home, and
happiest, perhaps, in the fellowship of commoner
men, such as Laidlaw, and Purdie, and John Usher,
and James Hogg, who were knit to him as soul to
soul. Of some of these he declared that they had
become almost an integral part of his existence.
We know how life was inexpressibly changed for
Scott minus Tom Purdie, and to dispense with
Laidlaw, when that had become absolutely necessary,
was as the iron entering his soul. The most
perfect pen-portraits in Lockhart are those of
Purdie (the Cristal Nixon of 'Redgauntlet'),
that faithful factotum and friend for whom he
mourned as a brother; and 'dear Willie' Laidlaw,
betwixt whom and Scott the most charming of
all master and servant correspondence passed;
and 'auld Pepe'&mdash;Peter Mathieson, his coachman,
a wondrously devoted soul, content to set
himself in the plough-stilts, and do the most menial
duties, rather than quit Abbotsford at its darkest.
John Swanston, too, Purdie's successor, and Dalgleish,
the butler, occupy exalted niches in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
temple of humble and honest worth and sweet
sacrificing service for a dear master's sake who
was much more than master to them all. Purdie's
grave, close to Melrose Abbey, with a modest
stone erected by Scott (see closing chapter), is
probably the most visited of the 'graves of the
common people' almost anywhere. It is seventy-six
years, since, apparently in the fullest enjoyment
of health and vigour, he bowed his head one evening
on the table, and dropped asleep&mdash;for ever. Laidlaw
lies at Contin amid the Highland solitudes. But
few from Tweedside have beheld the green turf
beneath which his loyal heart has been long resting,
or read the simple inscription on the white
marble that marks a spot so sacred to all lovers
of Abbotsford and Sir Walter.</p>

<p class="pn center">'Here lie the remains of William Laidlaw,<br />
Born at Blackhouse in Yarrow,<br />
November, 1780. Died at Contin, May 18, 1845.'</p>

<p class="p1">No account of the Abbotsford life can fail to
take notice of the extraordinary number of visitors,
who, even at that early date, flocked to the shrine
of Sir Walter. The year 1825, as has been said,
must be regarded as the high-water mark in the
splendours of Abbotsford. From the dawn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
'Waverley,' but particularly the period immediately
preceding the crash, Abbotsford was the most
sought-after house in the kingdom. It was seldom
without its quota of guests. 'Like a cried fair,'
Scott described it on one occasion. 'A hotel
widout de pay,' was Lady Scott's more matter-of-fact
comparison. What a profoundly interesting
and curious record a register of visitors to Abbotsford
would have been! We may regret, like
Lockhart, that none was ever attempted. His
pages, however, supply to some extent the lack of
such a list. One is amazed at its vastness and cosmopolitanism.
Scott's visitors came from all parts
of the compass. Even then the ubiquitous American
led the way, much less reticent and more irrepressible
than his modern representative. Of Continental
visitors to Britain in the early part of last
century, not a few, Lockhart says, crossed the
Channel, chiefly as a consequence of their interest
in Scott's writings, and in the hope of seeing the
man himself under his own roof. As for the more
intellectual of his own countrymen, Lockhart will
be surprised if it can be shown that any of them
crossed the Tweed without spending a day at
Abbotsford.</p>

<p>It was Scott's ambition to assemble at his board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
some of the best blood of the country, and at the
height of his prosperity he is said to have entertained
as many persons of distinction in rank, politics, art,
literature, and science, as the foremost nobleman of
his age ever did in the like space of time. Lockhart
computes that one out of every six of the
British Peerage had dined at Scott's table. Prince
Leopold, afterwards Leopold I. of the Belgians,
husband of the Princess Charlotte, and the exiled
Crown Prince Gustavus of Sweden, were guests at
Abbotsford in 1819 and 1820 respectively. With
the leading Border families Scott was on the best
of terms, and the neighbouring gentry were all,
more or less, included within the Abbotsford circle.
Of his literary friendships some account will be
found in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Nor was Scott above introducing his poorer
relations to Abbotsford. No old acquaintance or
family connections, however remote their station
or style of manners, were forgotten or lost sight of.
These were welcome guests, whoever might be
under his roof; and it was the same with many an
old classmate, or the fellow-apprentice who had
faced him at the desk when he was proud to earn
threepence a page in drudging pen-work. 'To
dwell on nothing else,' says Lockhart, 'it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
surely a beautiful perfection of real universal
humanity and politeness that could enable this
great and good man to blend guests so multifarious
in one group, or contrive to make them all equally
happy with him, with themselves, and with each
other.'</p>

<p>Whilst, however, Abbotsford was a kind of ever
open door to an unparalleled variety of guests,
there was another and a much larger company
constantly invading its precincts&mdash;the great army
of the uninvited. Such interruptions were a constant
source of worry to Scott. Lockhart counted
in one day no fewer than sixteen parties begging
admittance. It was impossible at that time, it was
said, to pass between Melrose and Abbotsford
'without encountering some odd figure, armed with
a sketch-book, evidently bent on a peep at the
Great Unknown.' Some came furnished with
letters of introduction from friends for whose sake
Scott received them cordially, and treated them
kindly. Others had no introduction at all, but,
pencil and note-book in hand, took the most impertinent
liberties with the place and its occupants.
On returning to Abbotsford upon one occasion,
Lockhart recalls how Scott and he found Mrs.
Scott and her daughters doing penance under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
merciless curiosity of a couple of tourists who had
been with her for some hours. They were rich
specimens&mdash;tall, lanky young men, both of them
rigged out in new jackets and trousers of the
Macgregor tartan, the one a lawyer, the other a
Unitarian preacher from New England. These
gentlemen, when told on their arrival that Scott
was not at home, had shown such signs of impatience
that the servant took it for granted they
must have serious business, and asked if they
would wish to speak a word with his lady. They
grasped at this, and so conducted themselves in the
interview that Mrs. Scott never doubted they had
brought letters of introduction to her husband, and
invited them accordingly to partake of her luncheon.
They had been walking about the house and
grounds with her and her daughters ever since that
time, and appeared at the porch, when the Sheriff
and his party returned to dinner, as if they had
been already fairly enrolled on his visiting-list.
For the moment he too was taken in; he fancied
that his wife must have received and opened their
credentials, and shook hands with them with
courteous cordiality. But Mrs. Scott, with all her
overflowing good nature, was a sharp observer;
and she, before a minute had elapsed, interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the ecstatic compliments of the strangers by reminding
them that her husband would be glad to
have the letters of the friends who had been so
good as to write by them. It then turned out
that there were no letters to be produced, and
Scott, signifying that his hour for dinner approached,
added that, as he supposed they meant to walk to
Melrose, he could not trespass further on their
time. The two lion-hunters seemed quite unprepared
for this abrupt escape. But there was
about Scott, in perfection, when he chose to exert
it, the power of civil repulsion. He bowed the
overwhelmed originals to the door, and on reentering
the parlour, found Mrs. Scott complaining
very indignantly that they had gone so far as to
pull out their note-book and beg an exact account,
not only of his age, but of her own. Scott, already
half relenting, laughed heartily at this misery, afterwards
saying, 'Hang the Yahoos, Charlotte, but
we should have bid them stay dinner.' 'Devil
a bit,' quoth Captain Ferguson, who had come
over from Huntlyburn, 'they were quite in a
mistake, I could see. The one asked Madame
whether she deigned to call her new house Tully
Veolan or Tillietudlem, and the other, when
Maida happened to lay his head against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
window, exclaimed, "<i>Pro-di-gi-ous!</i>"' 'Well, well,
Skipper,' was the reply, 'for a' that, the loons
would hae been nane the waur o' their kail.'</p>

<p>Much has been written of Scott and his dogs&mdash;not
the least important part of the establishment.
All true poets, from Homer downwards, have loved
dogs. Scott was seldom without a 'tail' at his
heels. His special favourites, Camp and Maida
(the Bevis of 'Woodstock'), are as well-known as
himself. Both were frequently painted by Raeburn
and others. When Camp died at Castle Street,
Scott excused himself from a dinner-party on
account of 'the death of a dear old friend'&mdash;a fine
compliment to the canine tribe&mdash;a finer index to
the heart of the man. Scott looked upon his dogs
as companions, 'not as the brute, but the mute
creation.' He loved them for their marvellously
human traits, and we know how they reciprocated
his affection. He was always caring for them.
When the financial cloud burst, there is this touching
record in the Diary: 'I was to have gone there
(Abbotsford) on Saturday in joy and prosperity to
receive my friends. My dogs will wait for me in
vain. It is foolish, but the thought of parting with
these dumb creatures has moved me more than any
of the painful reflections I have put down. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
things! I must get them kind masters! There
may be yet those who, loving me, may love my
dog, because it has been mine.... I feel my
dogs' feet on my knees; I hear them whining and
seeking me everywhere. This is nonsense, but it is
what they would do could they know how things
may be.' 'Be very careful of the dogs,' was his last
request to Laidlaw on the eve of setting out for
Italy. And when, close on a year afterwards, he
returned so deadly stricken, it was his dogs fondling
about him which for the most part resuscitated the
sense of 'home, sweet home.'</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">AN ABBOTSFORD BEAD-ROLL</p>

<p class="pn p2">Of Scott's friendships in the world of letters,
Lockhart's account runs like a silver thread through
the Life. Many of his strongest ties were on the
literary side. His attitude to literature was a curious
one, however. Notwithstanding the unique place
which he held, and his unrivalled popularity, his
successes, from an author's point of view, were
accepted with singular sang-froid. Nor was he
ever heard to profess a love of literature for its
own sake. Carlyle's statement that, with Scott,
literature was mainly a means to an end&mdash;and a
material enough one at that&mdash;it is to be feared, is
only too true. His fictional work was made
entirely subsidiary to the other and more
tangible creations of his imagination and ambition&mdash;Abbotsford,
and the race of Abbotsford Scotts.
Literary reputation, he was fond of saying, while
a bright enough feather in one's cap, is never a
substantial covering for the head. 'He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
considered,' says Lockhart, 'any amount of literary
distinction as entitled to be spoken of in the same
breath with mastery in the higher departments of
practical life&mdash;least of all, with the glory of a first-rate
captain. To have done things worthy to be
written was a dignity to which no man made any
approach who had only written things worthy to
be read.' Of his own work he seldom spoke,
except to his intimates. The making of a book he
held to be no great matter, and to the glory which
might be won thereby 'one is apt,' he said,
'to ascribe an undue degree of consequence.'
Recounting his introduction to the Iron Duke,
he told Ballantyne that he had felt awed and
abashed as never before in the presence of the
man whom he regarded not only as the greatest
soldier, but also as the greatest statesman of the
age. Ballantyne suggested that, on his part, the
Duke had seen before him a great poet, and
the greatest novelist of the age. Scott smiled.
'What,' said he, 'would the Duke of Wellington
think of a few <i>bits of novels</i>, which perhaps he had
never read, and for which the strong probability is
that he would not care a sixpence if he had?' 'I
have more than once,' said Laidlaw, 'heard Sir
Walter assert that, had his father left him an estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of £500 or £600 a year, he would have spent his
time in miscellaneous reading, not writing.' This,
to a certain extent, might have been the case. It
is hardly likely, however. Had he not tasted
blood in the success of the 'Minstrelsy,' and the
magnificent reception given to the verse romances,
matters might have been different. But, so singularly
successful at the first venture, it was not
possible for Scott to restrain himself from further
achievements. Writing was as natural to him as
breathing. From boyhood he had a penchant for
letters. And had he not been 'making himself'
right on from Sandyknowe and Kelso to Lasswade
and Ashestiel? The fruit came late, but what a
crop! Still, it was nothing for him, in one aspect
of it, to be the uncrowned king of his country's
literature. So far as it made him Scott of Abbotsford,
that was a much more real matter.</p>

<p>We have seen how Abbotsford, in its palmy
days, was the most popular guest-house in the
kingdom. To the intellectual lions of the time its
doors offered a specially gracious welcome. Never
did gatherings glisten with a more resplendent genius
or such genuine good-fellowship. An Abbotsford
'noctes' was worth dozens at Ambrose's, as Lockhart
and the contemporary biographies evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>To the present bead-roll, which is based almost
entirely on the Biography, Thomas Faed's picture,
'Scott and his Literary Friends,'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> offers a good
index. The piece is purely imaginary, for the
persons represented were never all at Abbotsford
at the same time, two of them, indeed&mdash;Crabbe
and Campbell&mdash;never having seen it. Scott is
represented as reading the manuscript of a new
novel; on his right, Henry Mackenzie, his oldest
literary friend, occupies the place of honour.
Hogg, the intentest figure in the group, sits at
Scott's feet to the left. Kit North's leonine head
and shoulders lean across the back of a chair.
Next come Crabbe and Lockhart&mdash;at the centre of
the table&mdash;together with Wordsworth and Francis
(afterwards Lord) Jeffrey. Sir Adam Ferguson,
a bosom cronie, cross-legged, his military boots
recalling Peninsular days and the reading of
the 'Lady of the Lake' to his comrades in the
lines of Torres Vedras, immediately faces Scott.
Behind him, Moore and Campbell sit opposite
each other. At the end of the table are the
printers Constable and Ballantyne, and at theirback, standing, the painters Allan and Wilkie.
Thomas Thomson, Deputy Clerk Register, is on
the extreme left, and Sir Humphry Davy is examining
a sword-hilt. A second and smaller copy
of Faed's picture (in the Woodlands Park collection,
Bradford) substitutes Lord Byron and Washington
Irving for Constable and Ballantyne. Allan,
Davy, and Thomson are also omitted. The artist
might well have introduced Scott's lady literary
friends, Joanna Baillie and Maria Edgeworth,
and it is a pity that Laidlaw has been left out.</p>

<p class="ppq20 p1">'Then rise those crags, that mountain tower<br />
Which charm'd my fancy's wakening hour;<br />
It was a barren scene and wild,<br />
Where naked cliffs were rudely piled;<br />
But ever and anon between<br />
Lay velvet tufts of loveliest green;<br />
And well the lonely infant knew<br />
Recesses where the wall-flower grew,<br />
And honeysuckle loved to crawl<br />
Up the low crag and ruin'd wall.<br />
And still I thought that shatter'd tower<br />
The mightiest work of human power;<br />
And marvell'd as the aged bind<br />
With some strange tale bewitch'd my mind,<br />
Of forayers who, with headlong force,<br />
Down from that strength had spurr'd their horse,<br />
Their southern rapine to renew<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Such a picture suggests instinctively the table-talk
of Abbotsford. One cannot help regretting
the absence of a volume on the subject, apart
from Lockhart. What would 'Bozzy' not have
given for the opportunity! Lockhart, naturally,
scorned to 'Boswellize' his hero. Notwithstanding
the sterling excellence of the Biography, with
its reproductions of many rare conversations and
chronicling of scores of delightful little incidents,
some of the finest things that fell from Scott's lips
and from his guests must have perished irretrievably.
Laidlaw, it is said, was urged to play the rôle of
Boswell, but declined, yet few could have done it
better. He was part of the establishment, and
hardly any company was considered complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
without his quiet and sagacious presence. Scott
once remarked when they were alone, after a
specially brilliant night, that many a one, meeting
such people and hearing such talk, might make
excellent 'copy' out of it in a very lively and
entertaining book, which would be sure to be read
with interest. Hence the value of the 'Abbotsford
Notanda'&mdash;Laidlaw's correspondence and other
papers, collected and edited by Robert Carruthers&mdash;with
no thought, possibly, on Laidlaw's part, of
their ever being printed. It is a perfect little gem
of its kind&mdash;one of the sweetest pictures of the
Abbotsford life and of that winsomely ideal relationship
which existed between Sir Walter and his
steward. No student of Scott can overlook it. As
the writer, be it noted also, of one of the most
touching and characteristic Scottish ballads, 'Lucy's
Flittin',' and an enthusiastic collaborateur with
Scott in the 'Minstrelsy,' Laidlaw will always
merit the most honourable remembrance.</p>

<p class="b1">It is interesting to recall that Scott's first really
distinguished visitor from the arena of letters was
from the other side of the Atlantic&mdash;Washington
Irving, an American of the Americans. Irving's
visit, doubtless, helped to modify Scott's estimate of
his countrymen. He did not at first care for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of his Yankee admirers, but by-and-by not a few of
them became friends for life. Campbell introduced
Irving to Scott. 'When you see Tom Campbell,'
wrote Scott to Richardson of Kirklands, 'tell
him, with my best love, that I have to thank him
for making me known to Mr. Washington Irving,
who is one of the best and pleasantest acquaintances
I have made this many a day.' Irving was the
guest&mdash;if we except Basil Hall at a later period&mdash;who
made the most of his brief stay at Abbotsford.
He was there in August, 1817, whilst the building
operations were in progress. Some parts of his
famous and classical essay are too good and too
graphic not to be quoted at length.</p>

<p class="pbq">'While the postilion was on his errand, I had
time to survey the mansion. It stood some short
distance below the road, on the side of a hill
sweeping down to the Tweed; and was as yet but a
snug gentleman's cottage, with something rural
and picturesque in its appearance. The whole
front was overrun with evergreens, and immediately
above the portal was a great pair of elk horns,
branching out from beneath the foliage, and giving
the cottage the look of a hunting-lodge. The huge
baronial pile, to which this modest mansion in a
manner gave birth, was just emerging into existence;
part of the walls, surrounded by scaffolding, already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
had risen to the height of the cottage, and the
courtyard in front was encumbered by masses of
hewn stone.</p>

<p class="pbq">'The noise of the chaise had disturbed the quiet
of the establishment. Out sallied the warder of the
castle, a black greyhound, and, leaping on one of
the blocks of stone, began a furious barking. His
alarm brought out the whole garrison of dogs, all
open-mouthed and vociferous. In a little while the
"lord of the castle" himself made his appearance.
I knew him at once by the descriptions I had read
and heard, and the likenesses that had been
published of him. He was tall, and of a large and
powerful frame. His dress was simple, and almost
rustic. An old green shooting-coat, with a dog-whistle
at the buttonhole, brown linen pantaloons,
stout shoes that tied at the ankles, and a white hat
that had evidently seen service. He came limping
up the gravel walk, aiding himself by a stout
walking-staff, but moving rapidly and with vigour.
By his side jogged along a large iron-grey staghound
of most grave demeanour, who took no part in the
clamour of the canine rabble, but seemed to consider
himself bound, for the dignity of the house, to give
me a courteous reception.</p>

<p class="pbq">'Before Scott had reached the gate he called out
in a hearty tone, welcoming me to Abbotsford, and
asking news of Campbell. Arrived at the door of
the chaise, he grasped me warmly by the hand:
"Come, drive down, drive down to the house,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
said he; "you're just in time for breakfast, and
afterwards ye shall see all the wonders of the
Abbey."</p>

<p class="pbq">'I would have excused myself, on the plea of
having already made my breakfast. "Hout, man,"
cried he, "a ride in the morning in the keen air of
the Scotch hills is warrant enough for a second
breakfast."</p>

<p class="pbq">'I was accordingly whirled to the portal of the
cottage, and in a few moments found myself seated
at the breakfast-table. There was no one present
but the family, which consisted of Mrs. Scott, her
eldest daughter Sophia, then a fine girl about
seventeen, Miss Anne Scott, two or three years
younger, Walter, a well-grown stripling, and
Charles, a lively boy, eleven or twelve years of age.
I soon felt myself quite at home, and my heart in
a glow with the cordial welcome I experienced. I
had thought to make a mere morning visit, but
found I was not to be let off so lightly. "You
must not think our neighbourhood is to be read in
a morning, like a newspaper," said Scott. "It takes
several days of study for an observant traveller that
has a relish for auld-world trumpery. After breakfast
you shall make your visit to Melrose Abbey.
When you come back, I'll take you out on a ramble
about the neighbourhood. To-morrow we will
take a look at the Yarrow, and the next day we
will drive over to Dryburgh Abbey, which is a fine
old ruin well worth your seeing." In a word, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Scott had got through with his plan, I found myself
committed for a visit of several days, and it seemed
as if a little realm of romance was suddenly opened
before me....</p>

<p class="pbq">'After my return from Melrose Abbey, Scott
proposed a ramble to show me something of the
surrounding country. As we sallied forth, every
dog in the establishment turned out to attend us.
There was the old staghound Maida, a noble
animal, and a great favourite of Scott's; and
Hamlet, the black greyhound, a wild, thoughtless
youngster, not yet arrived to years of discretion;
and Finette, a beautiful setter, with soft silken
hair, long pendent ears, and a mild eye&mdash;the parlour
favourite. When in front of the house, we
were joined by a superannuated greyhound, who
came from the kitchen wagging his tail, and was
cheered by Scott as an old friend and comrade.</p>

<p class="pbq">'In our walks, Scott would frequently pause in
conversation to notice his dogs and speak to them,
as if rational companions; and, indeed, there appears
to be a vast deal of rationality in these faithful
attendants on man, derived from their close intimacy
with him. Maida deported himself with
a gravity becoming his age and size, and seemed
to consider himself called upon to preserve a great
degree of dignity and decorum in our society. As
he jogged along a little distance ahead of us, the
young dogs would gambol about him, leap on his
neck, worry at his ears, and endeavour to tease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
him into a frolic. The old dog would keep on for
a long time with imperturbable solemnity, now
and then seeming to rebuke the wantonness of his
young companions. At length he would make a
sudden turn, seize one of them, and tumble him in
the dust; then, giving a glance at us, as much as
to say, "You see, gentlemen, I can't help giving
way to this nonsense," would resume his gravity
and jog on as before.</p>

<p class="pbq">'Scott amused himself with these peculiarities.
"I make no doubt," said he, "when Maida is alone
with these young dogs he throws gravity aside,
and plays the boy as much as any of them; but he
is ashamed to do so in our company, and seems to
say, 'Ha' done with your nonsense, youngsters;
what will the laird and that other gentleman think
of me if I give way to such foolery?'" ...</p>

<p class="pbq">'We rambled on among scenes which had been
familiar in Scottish song, and rendered classic by
the pastoral muse, long before Scott had thrown
the rich mantle of his poetry over them. What a
thrill of pleasure did I feel when first I saw the
broom-covered tops of the Cowdenknowes peeping
above the grey hills of the Tweed! and what
touching associations were called up by the sight
of Ettrick Vale, Gala Water, and the Braes of
Yarrow! Every turn brought to mind some
household air&mdash;some almost forgotten song of the
nursery, by which I had been lulled to sleep in my
childhood; and with them the looks and voices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
those who had sung them, and who were now no
more. It is these melodies, chanted in our ears in
the days of infancy, and connected with the
memory of those we have loved, and who have
passed away, that clothe Scottish landscape with
such tender associations....</p>

<p class="pbq">'Our ramble took us on the hills, commanding an
extensive prospect. "Now," said Scott, "I have
brought you, like the pilgrim in the 'Pilgrim's Progress,'
to the top of the Delectable Mountains,
that I may show you all the goodly regions hereabouts.
Yonder is Lammermoor and Smailholm;
and there you have Galashiels, and Torwoodlee,
and Gala Water; and in that direction you see
Teviotdale, and the Braes of Yarrow, and Ettrick
stream, winding along, like a silver thread, to
throw itself into the Tweed."</p>

<p class="pbq">'He went on thus to call over names celebrated
in Scottish song, and most of which had recently
received a romantic interest from his own pen. In
fact, I saw a great part of the Border Country
spread out before me, and could trace the scenes
of those poems and romances which had, in a
manner, bewitched the world. I gazed about me
for a time with mute surprise, I may almost say
with disappointment. I beheld a mere succession
of grey waving hills, line beyond line, as far as my
eye could reach, monotonous in their aspect, and
so destitute of trees that one could almost see a
stout fly walking along their profile; and the farfamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Tweed appeared a naked stream, flowing
between bare hills, without a tree or thicket on its
banks; and yet, such had been the magic web of
poetry and romance thrown over the whole, that it
had a greater charm for me than the richest scenery
I beheld in England.</p>

<p class="pbq">'I could not help giving utterance to my thoughts.
Scott hummed for a moment to himself, and looked
grave; he had no idea of having his muse complimented
at the expense of his native hills. "It
may be partiality," said he, at length; "but to my
eye, these grey hills and all this wild Border Country
have beauties peculiar to themselves. I like the
very nakedness of the land; it has something bold,
and stern, and solitary about it. When I have
been for some time in the rich scenery about Edinburgh,
which is like ornamented garden land, I
begin to wish myself back again among my honest
grey hills; and if I did not see the heather at least
once a year, <i>I think I should die</i>!" The last words
were said with an honest warmth, accompanied with
a thump on the ground with his staff, by way of
emphasis, that showed his heart was in his speech.'</p>

<p class="p1">Following Irving's visit came Lady Byron&mdash;for
a day only&mdash;spent on the banks of the Yarrow.
Lord Byron never was at Abbotsford. Scott and
he met at John Murray's London house and elsewhere,
and they frequently corresponded. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the old heroes in Homer, they exchanged gifts.
Scott gave Byron a beautiful dagger mounted with
gold, which had been the property of the redoubted
Elfi Bey, and some time after, Byron sent to
Abbotsford a large sepulchral vase of silver, filled
with dead men's bones from the Piræus, and suitably
inscribed. A letter from the noble poet accompanying
the gift was filched from the vase, much to
Scott's annoyance.</p>

<p>That same year, 1817, Sir David Wilkie painted
his incongruous 'Abbotsford Family' (in the
Scottish National Gallery), wherein Scott figures
as a miller and the rest of the group as peasants.
Sir Adam Ferguson, who commissioned the picture,
was depicted as a poacher. Wilkie's impressions
of Abbotsford, in a letter to his sister,
reveal the pleasant nature of his visit. 'I have
never been in any place,' he says, 'where there is so
much real good humour and merriment. There is
nothing but amusement from morning till night, and
if Scott is really writing "Rob Roy," it must be while
we are sleeping.' (That was practically so.) 'He
is either out planting trees, superintending the
masons, or erecting fences, the whole of the day.
He goes frequently out hunting, and this morning
there was a whole cavalcade of us out hunting hard.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Lockhart at Abbotsford, which he first saw in
1818, merits a chapter to himself. Sir Humphry
Davy and Dr. Wollaston, natural philosophers
both, Henry Mackenzie, and William Stewart
Rose, translator of Ariosto, to whom Scott dedicated
the first canto of 'Marmion,' were at Abbotsford
in 1820. Of their doings (unliterary) some
account will be found in the preceding pages.
The year 1823, when Miss Edgeworth visited
Abbotsford, Lockhart believes to be the happiest
in Scott's life. Probably no more welcome guest
crossed his threshold. Scott and she corresponded
occasionally. As a matter of fact, it was Maria's
delightful delineations of Irish life and character
which inspired him to try his own hand at fiction.
Long had he hoped to meet her. At last the
novelist of 'Castle Rackrent' and 'The Absentee'
was in Scotland, with Abbotsford as her objective.
Barely had she and her sister reached Edinburgh
before a note came from Scott begging them to
venture to his house that very night, late as it was,
and just as they were, to hear the Laird of Staffa
and some of his clansmen singing Highland boat-songs.
'Ten o'clock struck,' writes Miss Edgeworth,
'as I read this note. We were tired; we
were not fit to be seen; but I sent for a hackney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and just as we were, without dressing, we went.
As the coach stopped, we saw the hall lighted, and
the moment the door opened, heard the joyous
sounds of loud singing. Three servants: 'The
Miss Edgeworths!' sounded from hall to landing-place;
and as I paused for a moment in the ante-room,
I heard the first sound of Walter Scott's
voice&mdash;'The Miss Edgeworths?&mdash;come!' Thus
the eventful meeting took place, and the friendship
of two lives long intimate, so far as correspondence
can be said to create intimacy, seems to have grown
to its full height, literally at their first hand-clasp.
Here is Scott's opinion of the 'little Irish lioness,'
as he called her: 'It is scarcely possible to say
more of this remarkable person than that she not
only completely answered, but exceeded the expectations
which I had formed. I am particularly
pleased with the naïveté and good-humoured
ardour of mind which she unites with such formidable
powers of acute observation.' 'Never did I see
a brighter day at Abbotsford,' says Lockhart, 'than
that on which Miss Edgeworth first arrived there;
never can I forget her look and accent when she
was received by Scott at his archway, and exclaimed:
'Everything about you is exactly what
one ought to have had wit enough to dream!' The
visit was a series of fêtes. The weather, on its
good behaviour, allowed of an out-of-doors life to
the full. One day they picnicked at Cauldshiels.
Another, the whole party feasted by the Rhymer's
Waterfall in the Glen, and the stone on which Maria
sat was ever afterwards called 'Edgeworth's stone.'
A third day they drove to the Upper Yarrow, and
about sunset the baskets were unpacked beside
St. Mary's Chapel of the Lowes, or all that remains
of it, high up on the hillside, overlooking the
shining waters of the Loch. The young ladies
trimmed their hair with heather and blue-bells, and
some of the party sang, and Scott recited, until it
was time to go home beneath the softest of harvest
moons. So passed that halcyon fortnight, and Miss
Edgeworth never saw Abbotsford again. But
exactly two years later, Mr. Lovell Edgeworth
threw open the doors of his classical mansion at
Edgeworthstown to the Wizard of the North, and
Maria, with her brother and sister, accompanied
him to Killarney amid a succession of festive gaiety
wherever they halted.</p>

<p class="pn p1">John Leycester Adolphus, author of the 'Letters
to Heber,' unmasking the 'Great Unknown' in
proof that 'Marmion' and 'Waverley' were from
the same pen, was a frequent guest from 1823<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
onwards. His 'Memoranda, like Irving's and
Hall's, discloses interesting little sidelights of Scott
as seen by an outsider. There is nothing better
than his exquisite description of Scott's laugh:
'Never, perhaps, did a man go through all the
gradations of laughter with such complete enjoyment
and a countenance so radiant. The first
dawn of a humorous thought would show itself
sometimes, as he sat silent, by an involuntary
lengthening of the upper lip, followed by a shy
sidelong glance at his neighbours, indescribably
whimsical, and seeming to ask from their looks
whether the spark of drollery should be suppressed
or allowed to blaze out. In the full tide of mirth
he did, indeed, laugh the heart's laugh, like
Walpole, but it was not boisterous and overpowering,
nor did it check the course of his words.
He could go on telling or descanting, while his
lungs did 'crow like chanticleer,' his syllables, in
the struggle, growing more emphatic, his accent
more strongly Scotch, and his voice plaintive with
excess of merriment.'</p>

<p>Tom Moore came in 1825&mdash;the culminating
year. Scott and he had only once met, in public,
some twenty years earlier. Abbotsford, curiously,
but luckily for Moore, was absolutely guestless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
during his visit. Scott enjoyed having the author
of 'Lalla Rookh' all to himself, and sacrificed his
mornings, usually sacred to work, in honour of the
occasion. The liking between the two men was
immediate, but none the less profound. To
Moore&mdash;and tired, doubtless, of the long mask-wearing&mdash;Scott
confessed the Novels' authorship,
the first avowal outside his own circle. On the
third day Moore's Diary notes that Scott, 'laying
his hand cordially on my breast, said: "Now, my
dear Moore, we are friends for life."' Together
they called on Laidlaw at Kaeside, the Fergusons
at Huntlyburn, saw Melrose, and in the evening
Scott 'collected his neighbours to enjoy his guest,
with the wit and humour of Sir Adam Ferguson,
his picturesque stories of the Peninsula, and his
inimitable singing of the old Jacobite ditties.' 'I
parted from Scott,' says Moore, 'with the feeling
that all the world might admire him in his works,
but that those only could learn to love him as he
deserved who had seen him at Abbotsford.' And
there is no passage in Moore's memoirs more
evidently sincere than that in which he expresses
(only a few months later) his 'deep and painful
sympathy' in the news of Scott's financial misfortune:
'For poor devils like me (who have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
known better) to fag and to be pinched for means,
becomes, as it were, a second nature; but for Scott,
whom I saw living in such luxurious comfort, and
dispensing such cordial hospitality, to be thus
suddenly reduced to the necessity of working his
way is too bad, and I grieve for him from my heart.'</p>

<p class="b1">Arthur Henry Hallam, of 'In Memoriam,' cut
off in the very bloom of life and genius, accompanied
by his father, the historian, was at Abbotsford
in 1829. His beautiful verses, 'written after
visiting Melrose Abbey in company of Scott,' have
been often reprinted:</p>

<p class="pplq20">'I lived an hour in fair Melrose;</p>
<p class="ppli25">It was not when the "pale moonlight"</p>
<p class="ppli20">Its magnifying charm bestows;</p>
<p class="ppli25">Yet deem I that I "viewed it right."</p>
<p class="ppli20">The wind-swept shadows fast careered,</p>
<p class="ppli20">Like living things that joyed or feared,</p>
<p class="ppli20">Adown the sunny Eildon Hill,</p>
<p class="ppli20">And the sweet winding Tweed the distance crownèd well.</p>

<p class="pplq20 p1">'I inly laughed to see that scene</p>
<p class="ppli25">Wear such a countenance of youth,</p>
<p class="ppli20">Though many an age those hills were green,</p>
<p class="ppli25">And yonder river glided smooth,</p>
<p class="ppli20">Ere in these now disjointed walls</p>
<p class="ppli20">The Mother Church held festivals,</p>
<p class="ppli20">And full-voiced anthemings the while</p>
<p class="ppli20">Swelled from the choir, and lingered down the echoing aisle.</p>

<p class="pplq20 p1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>'I coveted that Abbey's doom;</p>
<p class="ppli25">For if, I thought, the early flowers</p>

<p class="ppli25">Like those green hills, through countless hours,</p>
<p class="ppli20">Grant me at least a tardy waning,</p>
<p class="ppli20">Some pleasure still in age's paining;</p>
<p class="ppli20">Though lines and forms must fade away,</p>

<p class="ppli20">Who, living, quiet never found,</p>
<p class="ppli25">I straightway learnt a lesson high:</p>
<p class="ppli20">For there an old man sat serene,</p>
<p class="ppli20">And well I knew that thoughtful mien</p>
<p class="ppli20">Of him whose early lyre had thrown</p>
<p class="ppli20">Over these mouldering walls the magic of its tone.</p>

<p class="pplq20 p1">'Then ceased I from my envying state,</p>

<p class="p1">That same summer Mrs. Hemans, visiting the
Hamiltons at Chiefswood, was daily at Abbotsford.
Lockhart has no mention of the occasion. See,
however, the references in the 'Journal.' As with
Miss Edgeworth, Scott piloted the 'poet of womanhood'
to Yarrow, and over into Ettrick, and in the
Rhymer's Glen he related the incident which gave
origin to her inspiring 'Rhine Song.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> At parting
with her, he said, 'There are some whom we meet
and should like ever after to claim as kith and kin;
and you are one of these.' Susan Ferrier, authoress
of 'Marriage,' 'Inheritance,' etc., novels of the
older school (in need of modern revival), visited
Scott in 1829, and again in 1831. 'This gifted
personage,' says the 'Journal,' 'besides having great
talents, has conversation the least <i>exigeante</i> of any
author&mdash;female, at least&mdash;whom I have ever seen
among the long list I have encountered&mdash;simple,
full of humour, and exceedingly ready at repartee;
and all this without the least affectation of the blue-stocking.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Wordsworth was the last of the giants to visit
Scott at Abbotsford. They met for the first time
at Lasswade Cottage as far back as 1803, and at
least on four other occasions, both in Scotland and
England. But how altered the circumstances of their
present meeting! Scott, a confirmed invalid, was
on the eve of saying farewell to Abbotsford practically
for ever. Wordsworth arrived on September
21, 1831, and Scott was to leave on the 23rd.
On the 22nd&mdash;the last day at home, and the last
one of real enjoyment&mdash;the two friends spent the
morning together in a visit to Newark. 'It was
a day to deepen both in Scott and Wordsworth
whatever of sympathy either of them had with the
very different genius of the other'; and that it had
this result in Wordsworth's case we know from the
very beautiful poem 'Yarrow Revisited,' and the
Sonnet ('A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping
rain'), which the occasion also produced. As
long as English poetry lives, so will the memory
of that last day of the Last Minstrel at
Newark:</p>

<p class="ppiq25">'Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,<br />

<p class="p1">Sitting in the Library that same night, the talk
turned on Smollett and Fielding, both driven
abroad, as Scott recalled, like himself, through
declining health, and we hardly wonder if there
was the feeling present to his mind that, like them,
he, too, might not return.</p>

<p>Mention of Yarrow instinctively calls up the
name of James Hogg, a true friend of Scott,
notwithstanding Lockhart's farrago. Hogg and
Lockhart were constantly misunderstanding one
another. In one sense, they were wide as the poles
asunder&mdash;Lockhart aristocratic to the finger-tips,
Hogg excessively plebeian. But that should have
made no difference. It made no difference with
Scott. Lockhart undoubtedly tried to help Hogg
a good deal, which Hogg resented more than once;
hence Lockhart's strictures. But for all that, the
Shepherd is a picturesque and lovable figure, even
in the pages of Lockhart. Hogg's alleged 'insult'
to the dust of Scott&mdash;the 'Scorpion's' most stinging
charge against him&mdash;amounts, after all, to very
little. That Hogg was never further from insult in
the writing of his little brochure<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> seems perfectly
clear. There are, to be sure, some things that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
been better left unsaid. But the book is, nevertheless,
one of the brightest and most natural pen-portraits
of Scott that we have. Hogg was a
regular visitor at Abbotsford. Laidlaw denies that
he ever, even in his cups, descended to 'Wattie'
and 'Charlotte.' Scott smiled at Hogg's inordinate
vanity, and Hogg had one or two stupid estrangements
with him. But Sir Walter's attachment to
his more humble compeer was never lessened in the
least until the day when the two friends parted for
ever at the Gordon Arms in Yarrow&mdash;the dearest
vale on earth to them both.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE WIZARD'S FAREWELL TO ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2 b1">On March 5, 1817, at Castle Street, in the midst
of a merry dinner-party, Scott was seized with a
sudden illness&mdash;the first since his childhood. The
disorder was cramp in the stomach of an unusually
severe type. From Gillies's 'Recollections' we
learn that, although disabled and compelled to
retire to his room, he was unwilling that the
festivity of the evening should be broken up, and
actually sent a message to Mrs. Siddons that
nothing would do him so much good as to hear her
sing. He would, he said, be all right in the
morning. But the illness lasted a week, and was
more serious than had been anticipated. It was,
indeed, the first of a series of such paroxysms, which
for years visited him periodically, and from which
he never absolutely recovered. Probably the best
index to his feelings at this period is found in
what may be described as the most pathetically
poetic verses he ever penned. He was at Abbotsford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
battling with depression and melancholy, and
seldom without a sense of pain. On the bare
height above Cauldshiels, with its then magnificent
prospect of Melrose and the open valley of the
Tweed, hemmed in on the west by the Selkirkshire
uplands, he wrote, on one lovely autumn evening,
these exquisite lines&mdash;exquisite because expressing
the deepest passion of his soul at the moment:</p>

<p class="ppiq25">'The sun upon the Weirdlaw Hill,<br />
In Ettrick's vale, is sinking sweet;</p>
<p class="ppi25">The westland wind is hush and still&mdash;<br />
The lake lies sleeping at my feet.</p>
<p class="ppi25">Yet not the landscape to mine eye<br />
Bears those bright hues that once it bore,</p>
<p class="ppi25">Though evening with her richest dye<br />
Flames o'er the hills of Ettrick's shore.</p>

<p class="ppiq25 p1">'With listless look along the plain<br />
I see Tweed's silver current glide,</p>
<p class="ppi25">And coldly mark the holy fane<br />
Of Melrose rise in ruin'd pride.</p>
<p class="ppi25">The quiet lake, the balmy air,<br />
The hill, the stream, the tower, the tree&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi25">Are they still such as once they were,<br />
Or is the dreary change in me?</p>

<p class="ppiq25 p1">'Alas! the warp'd and broken board,<br />
How can it bear the painter's dye!</p>
<p class="ppi25">The harp of strain'd and tuneless chord,<br />
How to the minstrel's skill reply!</p>
<p class="ppi25">To aching eyes each landscape lowers,<br />
To feverish pulse each gale blows chill,</p>
<p class="ppi25">And Araby's or Eden's bowers<br />
Were barren as this moorland hill.'</p>

<p class="ppq20 p1">
'Merrily swim we, the moon shines bright;<br />
There's a golden gleam on the distant height;<br />
There's a silver shower on the alders dank<br />
And the drooping willows that wave on the bank.<br />
I see the Abbey, both turret and tower&mdash;<br />
It is all astir for the vesper hour;<br />
The monks for the chapel are leaving each cell,<br />
But where's Father Philip, should toll the bell?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The 'change' in himself was visible enough. He
was worn almost to a skeleton, and sat on his horse
slanting, as if unable to hold himself upright. His
dress was threadbare and disordered, his countenance
meagre, haggard, and of the deadliest olive brown.
Afterwards, a single season blanched his hair snow-white.
The last days of the Last Minstrel seemed
to have come. Lockhart parted on one occasion
with 'dark prognostications' that it was for the
last time. Scott, too, despaired of himself. Calling
his children about his bed, he took leave of
them with solemn tenderness, adding, 'For myself,
my dears, I am unconscious of ever having
done any man an injury, or omitted any fair
opportunity of doing any man a benefit. I well
know that no human life can appear otherwise
than weak and filthy in the eyes of God; but I
rely on the merits and intercession of our Redeemer.'
'God bless you!' he again said to each of them,
laying his hand on their heads. 'Live so that you
may all hope to meet each other in a better place
hereafter.' Presently he fell into a profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
slumber, and on awaking, the crisis was seen to
be over. A gradual re-establishment of health
followed. Of the 'Bride of Lammermoor,' and
'Ivanhoe,' written under the most adverse circumstances,
whilst he still suffered acutely, one is
surprised to find both romances in the very front
rank of his creations. He was under opiates, more
or less, when the 'Bride' was on the stocks,
dictating nearly the whole of it to Laidlaw and
John Ballantyne. It is a most curious fact psychologically,
for of its characters, scenes, humour, and
all that connected him with the authorship of the
story, he recollected nothing. A more extraordinary
incident literature has not known.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But
work which cut him short in the end was the saving
of his life in this instance. The mind was a constant
conquest over the weaker physical framework.
'It is my conviction,' he declared to Gillies, 'that
by a little more hearty application you might
forget, and lose altogether, the irritable sensations
of an invalid, and I don't, in this instance, preach
what I have not endeavoured to practise. Be
assured that if pain could have prevented my
application to literary labour, not a page of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"Ivanhoe" would have been written; for, from
beginning to end of that production, which has
been a good deal praised, I was never free from
suffering. It might have borne a motto somewhat
analogous to the inscription which Frederick the
Great's predecessor used to affix to his attempts at
portrait-painting when he had the gout: "Fredericus
I., <i>in tormentis</i> pinxit." Now, if I had given
way to mere feelings and ceased to work, it is a
question whether the disorder might not have
taken deeper root, and become incurable. The
best way is, if possible, to triumph over disease by
setting it at defiance, somewhat on the same
principle as one avoids being stung by boldly
grasping a nettle.'</p>

<p>By 1820 he was enjoying tolerably good health,
with no cramp recurrences for a time. But in
1823, when busy with 'Peveril,' an arresting
hand laid itself upon Scott in the shape of a slight
stroke of apoplexy. As a matter of fact, and as
Lockhart suspected, this was only one of several
such shocks which he had been carefully concealing.
'"Peveril" will, I fear, smell of the apoplexy,' he
afterwards admitted. Hence, no doubt, 'Peveril's'
dulness'. He rallied, notwithstanding, and up to
Christmas, 1825, his health was excellent. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
from 1826&mdash;the year of his crowning sorrows&mdash;the
record of Scott's life reads like a long martyrdom.
Rheumatism, hallucinations, strange memory
lapses, began to steal from Scott all the little joy
that was left. On February 5, 1830, the blow fell
which, like Damocles' sword, had been hanging over
him for years. It fell with unmistakable meaning.
It was his first real paralytic seizure&mdash;long dreaded,
long expected. On his return from the Parliament
House, in his usual health, he found an old friend
waiting to consult him about a memoir of her
father which he had promised to revise for the
press. Whilst examining the MS. the stroke
came, a slight contortion passing over his features.
In a minute or two he rose, staggered to the
drawing-room, where were Miss Anne Scott and
Miss Lockhart, but fell to the floor speechless
and insensible. A surgeon quickly at hand cupped
him, after the old-fashioned treatment for such
complaints. By night, speech had returned, and
in a day or two he had resumed his Court duties.
But he was never the same again. People in
general did not remark any difference. Doctors
and patient, however, knew well enough that it
was the beginning of the end. Both his parents
had succumbed to paralysis, and 'considering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
terrible violence and agitation and exertion,' says
Lockhart, 'to which he had been subjected during
the four preceding years, the only wonder is that
this blow was deferred so long; there can be none
that it was soon followed by others.'</p>

<p>Still he plodded on. Even with half a brain he
should not 'lag superfluous on the stage.' And
heedless of innumerable warnings, he was at his
desk day after day, writing and dictating by turns.
He now resigned his Clerkship, on an £800 a year
allowance, surrendered his Edinburgh house, and
settled permanently at Abbotsford, lonely and
desolate, an old man before his time, but indomitable
to the core. There he commenced 'Count
Robert of Paris,' the penultimate of his published
tales. But the mighty machinery of his mind
moved not as of yore. Like Samson, his strength
had departed. He was now as other men. By
November he suffered from a second stroke, and
wrote in his Diary for January: 'Very indifferent,
with more awkward feelings than I can well bear
up against. My voice sunk, and my head strangely
confused.' But a worse shock was coming. Cadell
pronounced the 'Count' a complete failure. Yet
he struggled to recast it. To crown all, he went
to the 'hustings'&mdash;a hardened anti-Reform Billite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
At Jedburgh, as Lockhart tells, the crowd saluted
him with blasphemous shouts of 'Burke Sir
Walter!'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;the unkindest cut of all, which haunted
him to the end. By July he had begun 'Castle
Dangerous,' and in the middle of the month,
accompanied by Lockhart, he started for Lanarkshire
to refresh his memory for the setting of his
new story. They ascended the Tweed by Yair,
Ashestiel, Elibank, Innerleithen, Peebles, Biggar,
places all dear to his heart and celebrated in his
writings. Crowds turned out to welcome him.
Everywhere he was received with acclamation and
the deepest respect. At Douglas the travellers
inspected the old Castle, the ruin of St. Bride's,
with the monuments and tombs of the 'most
heroic and powerful family in Scottish annals.' At
Milton-Lockhart, the seat of Lockhart's brother,
Scott met his old friend Borthwickbrae. Both
were paralytics. Each saw his own case mirrored
in the other. They had a joyous&mdash;too joyous
a meeting, with startling results to the older
invalid. On returning to Cleghorn, another shock
laid him low, and he was despaired of. When the
news reached Scott, he was bent on getting home
at once. 'No, William,' he said to his host, urging
him to remain, 'this is a sad warning; I must home
to work while it is called to-day, for the night
cometh when no man can work. I put that text
many years ago on my dial-stone, but it often
preached in vain.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Returned, he finished 'Count Robert' and 'Castle
Dangerous.' Both novels were really the fruit of
a paralytic brain. The 'Magnum Opus,'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> too,
proposed by Cadell (a huge success), engaged much
of his attention. But Sir Walter's work was done.
At length, doctors' treatment doing him little good,
from his constant determination to be at his desk,
it was decided, not without difficulty, that Scott
should spend the winter of 1831 in Italy, where his
son Charles was attached to the British Legation
at Naples. On September 22 all was in readiness.
A round of touching adieus, one or two gatherings
of old friends, the final instructions to Laidlaw, and
Scott quitted Abbotsford practically for ever. He
returned, to be sure, but more a dead man than a
living one. Of his journey to London (meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
again with Moore, Milman, Croker, Wilkie, and
Washington Irving) there is no need to write,
nor of the Italian tour&mdash;Malta, Naples, Rome,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Florence, Venice&mdash;for which, no matter the brilliance
of their associations, he exhibited but a mere
passive interest. His heart was in the homeland.
<i>Its</i> voices had the strongest appeal for him; an
exile song rang in his ears:</p>

<p class="ppn20">'Hame! hame! hame! O hame fain wad I be!<br />
O hame! hame! hame! to my ain countrie.'</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Not a little of the scenery reminded him of
Scotland&mdash;Edinburgh, the Eildons, Cauldshiels,
Abbotsford. A peasant's lilt recalled the melodies
of the Border, and pathetically he repeated some
lines from 'Jock o' Hazeldean' and his boyhood's
'Hardyknute.' When, on March 22, he heard of
Goethe's death, whom he hoped to visit, he exclaimed:
'Alas for Goethe! but he at least died at
home; let us to Abbotsford!' Then, by-and-by,
the return journey was begun, viâ Switzerland, the
Tyrol, Munich, Heidelberg, to Frankfort and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Rhine. At Nimeguen, on June 9, he had another
attack of apoplexy, combined with paralysis. It
was the crowning blow. By the 13th, London was
reached, and in the St. James's Hotel, Jermyn
Street (now demolished), he lay for three weeks in
a state of supreme stupor. Allan Cunningham was
in London then, and tells of the extraordinary
interest and sympathy which Scott's illness evoked.
Walking home late one night, he found a number
of working men standing at the corner of Jermyn
Street, one of whom asked him, as if there had been
only one deathbed in London: 'Do you know, sir,
if this is the street where <i>he</i> is lying?' 'Abbotsford!'
was his cry in the more lucid intervals that
came to him. All its summer beauty seemed to be
standing out before him, and to beckon him northwards.
On July 7 he was carried on board the
<i>James Watt</i> steamer, accompanied by Lockhart,
Cadell, a medical man&mdash;Dr. Thomas Watson&mdash;and
his two daughters. The Forth was reached on the
9th, and the next two days&mdash;the last in his 'own
romantic town'&mdash;were passed, as all the voyage had
been, in a condition of absolute unconsciousness.
On the 11th, at a very early hour of the morning,
Scott was lifted into his carriage for the final
journey homewards. During the first part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
drive he remained torpid, until the veil lifted somewhat
at Gala Water. Strange that, after oblivion
so profound and prolonged, he should open his eyes
and regain a measure of consciousness just here,
amid landscapes the most familiar to him in the
world. Some good angel must have touched him
then. A mere coincidence! Perhaps! But there
are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in our philosophy. 'Gala Water, surely&mdash;Buckholm&mdash;Torwoodlee,'
he murmured. When
he saw the Eildons&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppiq25">'Three crests against the saffron sky,<br />
Beyond the purple plain,</p>
<p class="ppi25">The kind remembered melody<br />
Of Tweed once more again'&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 b1">he became greatly excited, and in crossing Melrose
Bridge, his 'nearest Rialto,' as he called it, he
could hardly be kept in the carriage. Abbotsford,
a mile ahead, was soon reached. Laidlaw&mdash;a big
lump in his throat, we may be sure&mdash;was waiting
at the door, and assisted to carry his dying master
and friend to the dining-room, where his bed had
been prepared. He sat bewildered for a moment
or two, then, resting his eyes on Laidlaw, as if
trying to recollect, said immediately, 'Ha, Willie
Laidlaw! O man, how often have I thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<i>you</i>!' By this time his dogs were around his chair,
fawning on him, and licking his hands. Then,
indeed, he knew where he was. Between sobs
and tears he tried to speak to them, and to stroke
them as of yore. But the body, no less than the
brain, was exhausted, and gentle sleep closed his
eyelids, like a tired child, once more in his own
Abbotsford. He lingered for some weeks, alternating
between cloud and sunshine&mdash;mostly cloud.
One day the longing for his desk seized him, and
he was wheeled studywards, but the palsied fingers
refused their office, and he sank back, assured at
last that the sceptre had departed. Lockhart and
Laidlaw were now his constant attendants. Both
read to him from the New Testament. 'There is
but one Book,' Scott said, and it 'comforted' him
to listen to its soothing and hope-inspiring utterances.
Then the cloud became denser. At last
delirium and delusion prostrated him, and he
grew daily feebler. Now he thought himself
administering justice as the Selkirkshire 'Shirra';
anon he was giving Tom Purdie orders anent
trees. Sometimes, his fancy was in Jedburgh, and
the words, 'Burke Sir Walter,' escaped him in
a dolorous tone. Then he would repeat snatches
from Isaiah, or the Book of Job, or some grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
rugged verse torn off from the Scottish Psalms,
or a strain sublimer still from the Romish Litany:</p>

<p class="ppq20">'Dies iræ, dies illa,<br />
Solvet sæclum in favilla.'</p>

<p class="p1">'As I was dressing on the morning of September 17,'
says Lockhart, 'Nicolson came into my room and
told me that his master had awoke in a state of
composure and consciousness, and wished to see
me immediately. I found him entirely himself,
though in the last extreme of feebleness. His eye
was clear and calm&mdash;every trace of the wild fire of
delirium extinguished. "Lockhart," he said, "I
may have but a minute to speak to you. My
dear, be a good man&mdash;be virtuous&mdash;be religious&mdash;be
a good man. Nothing else will give you any
comfort when you come to lie here." He paused,
and I said: "Shall I send for Sophia and Anne?"
"No," said he, "don't disturb them. Poor souls!
I know they were up all night. God bless you
all." With this he sunk into a very tranquil sleep,
and, indeed, he scarcely afterwards gave any sign
of consciousness, except for an instant on the
arrival of his sons. About half-past one p.m., on
September 21, Sir Walter Scott breathed his last,
in the presence of all his children. It was a
beautiful day&mdash;so warm that every window was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wide open, and so perfectly still that the sound of
all others most delicious to his ear, the gentle ripple
of the Tweed over its pebbles, was distinctly
audible as we knelt around the bed, and his eldest
son kissed and closed his eyes.'</p>

<p>He died a month after completing his sixty-first
year. On December 7, 1825, almost seven years
earlier, we find him taking a survey of his own
health in relation to the ages reached by his parents
and other members of the family, and then setting
down in his Diary the result of his calculations,
'Square the odds, and good-night, Sir Walter, about
sixty. I care not, if I leave my name unstained and
my family property settled. <i>Sat est vixisse.</i>' His
prophecy was fulfilled. He lived just a year&mdash;but
a year of gradual death&mdash;beyond his anticipations.
His wish, too, was fulfilled; for he died practically
free of debt. The sale of his works, the insurance
of his life, and a sum advanced by Cadell, completely
cleared his engagements.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>On September 26&mdash;a Wednesday&mdash;Sir Walter
was buried. Services at Abbotsford, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
simple fashion of the Scottish Kirk, were conducted
by the Revs. Principal Baird, of Edinburgh University,
Dr. Dickson, of St. Cuthbert's, and the
minister of Melrose. The courtyard and all the
precincts of Abbotsford were crowded with uncovered
spectators as the procession (over a mile
in length) was arranged. And as it advanced
through Darnick and Melrose, and the villages on
the route, the whole population appeared at their
doors in like manner, almost all in black. From
Darnick Tower<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a broad crape banner waved in
the wind, and the Abbey bell at Melrose rang a
muffled peel. At Leaderfoot the Tweed was
crossed for the last time. Thence there is a somewhat
steep ascent to Gladswood and Bemersyde.
On the crest of the road overlooking the 'beautiful
bend' the hearse came to a curious halt, at the
very spot where Scott was accustomed to rein up
his horses. It was no 'accident,' as Lockhart
imagines. For one of the horses was Sir Walter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
own, and must have borne him many a time
hither. Hence the explanation of an incident
which, strangely enough, seems to have puzzled
Lockhart, and was long regarded with a sort of
superstitious awe. It was late in the day&mdash;about
half-past five&mdash;before the memorable procession
reached Dryburgh. The wide enclosure was
thronged with old and young. Peter Mathieson,
Laidlaw, and others of Scott's servants carried the
plain black coffin to the grave within St. Mary's
aisle, where it was lowered by his two sons, his son-in-law,
and six of his cousins, Archdeacon Williams
reading the Burial Service of the Church of England.
And thus the remains of Sir Walter Scott&mdash;our
Scottish Shakespeare&mdash;were laid by the side of his
wife in the sepulchre of his fathers, 'in sure and
certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.'</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">LOCKHART AND ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">John Gibson Lockhart, next to Boswell the
greatest of British biographers, though Mr. Saintsbury
is inclined to class him even above Boswell,
was born in the manse of Cambusnethan, June 12,
1794.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He came of an ancestry of which he might
well be proud. Some of the best blood of Scotland
ran in his veins. Lockhart of Lee, in Lanarkshire,
was probably the source of his family. The
Lockharts had owned territory in the Upper
Ward for centuries, Symington, or Symon's Town,
famous now chiefly as a junction on the Caledonian
Railway, being, perhaps, their earliest possession.
The name is thought to be derived from Symon
Locard, who founded its church and assumed
lordship of the locality in the reign of Malcolm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Maiden. Lee itself may have been acquired about
the close of the thirteenth century by William
Locard, whose son, another Symon, was companion
to 'the Good' Sir James Douglas on his hazardous
mission with the heart of Bruce. Every schoolboy
knows how Douglas fell on a blood-red field of
Spain, how he flung the royal casket in front of
him with the cry, 'Forward, brave heart, as thou
wert wont; Douglas will follow thee or die,' and
how Locard assumed the lead, rescued the King's
heart and the body of his comrade, and, like a wise
man, returned to Scotland. Bruce's heart he laid by
the high altar at Melrose, the Douglas with his own
dear dust in the Kirk of St. Bride, among the Lanarkshire
uplands. It was this Symon who brought to
Scotland the famous Lee Penny&mdash;Scott's 'Talisman,'
the most celebrated charm in the country&mdash;a
heart-shaped, dark-red stone now set in a groat of
Edward IV., with a silver chain and ring attached,
and long sought after by the superstitious as a positive
cure for the worst ailments of man and beast.</p>

<p>Following Sir Symon Locard there comes on
the scene Sir Stephen Lockhart,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> as the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was now spelled, who held the lands of Cleghorn, in
the same county. He was the direct male ancestor
of John Gibson Lockhart, and almost certainly a
cadet of the Lee family. His son, Allan Lockhart
of Cleghorn, married for his second wife a
daughter of the third Lord Somerville, by whom
he had a son Stephen, Laird of Wicketshaw, also in
Lanarkshire. In 1606 another Stephen, grandson
of the latter, married Grizel Carmichael, a sister of
the first Lord Carmichael, and by her he had three
sons: William, heir to Wicketshaw; Robert of
Birkhill, in the parish of Lesmahagow; and Walter
of Kirkton. From the second of these, a noted
Covenanter and leader of the Lanark Whigs at
Bothwell, Scott's biographer had his immediate
descent. William Lockhart, grandson of Robert
of Birkhill, and his wife, Violet Inglis, of Corehouse,
had two sons, the second of whom was
the Rev. John Lockhart, D.D., minister of
Cambusnethan, and for nearly half a century of the
College Kirk, Glasgow. Dr. Lockhart was twice
married, and it was his second wife, Elizabeth
Gibson, daughter of the Rev. John Gibson, senior
minister of St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, who became
the mother of John Gibson Lockhart. Lockhart's
ancestry on his mother's side connects him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
James Nimmo the Covenanter, with the Erskines
of Cardross, and the Pringles of Torwoodlee.</p>

<p>While the boy was still young his parents removed
to Glasgow. There Lockhart matriculated,
and blossomed into a scholar of brilliant parts,
winning such academic blue ribbons as the Greek
Blackstone and a Snell Exhibition, which took
him to Oxford. He was at Balliol for some
years, and left in 1813 with a 'first' in Classics.
After a Continental visit (conversing with Goethe
at Weimar), he studied law at Edinburgh, and in
1816 was called to the Scottish Bar. His Parliament
House career came to a rather curious end,
however. Speechifying was not in his line. He
flustered and floundered upon every attempt, and
was a complete failure. And he might have perambulated
the boards of the Parliament Hall long
enough. For, like Scott, 'deil a ane speered his
price.' 'Gentlemen,' said he, in happy allusion to
this infirmity on the occasion of a banquet in his
honour long after he had relinquished the Bar,
'you know that if I could speak we would not be
here.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in the realm of literature (more alluring
than law) that Lockhart was fated to shine.
Already he had shown talent in that direction in
his 'Heraldry' article for Brewster's 'Encyclopædia,'
and a translation of Schlegel's 'Lectures on the
History of Literature.' And when <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> soared into the arena (1817), Lockhart
and John Wilson divided its chief honours. It
was largely under Lockhart that 'Maga' made its
position as the most pronounced Tory organ of the
day. In his earlier career Lockhart adopted the
slash-style of criticism (the tomahawk type)&mdash;incisive,
irritating, and keenly offensive, as a rule.
He was a master of satire, blazing away to his
heart's content, with many to fear him, but none
to stay his unsparing pen. If he could not speak,
he could at least write to purpose and with effect.
He had now come to his kingdom when the whole
torrent of thought, imagination, and genius, which
the Bar may have held in check, burst forth in
its full brilliance. He was then barely five-and-twenty,
and a handsomer fellow never stepped on
shoe-leather&mdash;tall, with dark Italian-like features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
inherited from his mother, close, tight lips, a mobile
chin, and temples clustering with huge masses of
curly jet hair. There is an admirable pen-portrait
of him in the 'Noctes' when Wilson makes the
Shepherd say: 'Wasna't me that first prophesied
his great abeelities when he was only an Oxford
Collegian wi' a pale face and a black toozy head, but
an e'e like an eagle's, an' a sort o' lauch about the
screwed-up mouth o' him that fules ca'd no canny?'</p>

<p>Though Lockhart must have seen Scott frequently
in public&mdash;in the Law Courts, the book-shops,
and elsewhere&mdash;he does not appear to have met
him in private society till the General Assembly
of May, 1818. The incident of the 'hand,' some
years previously, is so interesting, however, as
not to be overlooked in any notice of Lockhart
and Scott. Happening to pass through Edinburgh
in June, 1814, Lockhart relates how, along
with a band of budding barristers, he dined at
a friend's house in George Street whose windows
overlooked at right angles the back of Scott's
town-house and study at 39, Castle Street. As
the merry evening advanced, Lockhart observed a
strange dulness settling over his friend's demeanour,
and fear of his being unwell bade him put the
question. 'No,' said he, 'I shall be well enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
presently if you will only let me sit where you
are, and take my chair; for there is a confounded
hand in sight of me here which has often bothered
me before, and now it won't let me fill my
glass with a goodwill.' 'I rose to change places
with him,' says Lockhart, 'and he pointed out
to me this hand, which, like the writing on Belshazzar's
wall, disturbed his hour of hilarity.'
'Since we sat down,' he said, 'I have been watching
it; it fascinates my eye; it never stops; page after
page is finished and thrown on that heap of manuscript,
and still it goes on unwearied&mdash;and so it will
be till candles are brought in, and God knows how
long after that. It is the same every night; I can't
stand a sight of it when I am not at my books.'
'Some stupid, dogged, engrossing clerk, probably,'
exclaimed Lockhart, 'or some other giddy youth
in the company.' 'No, boys,' said their host, 'I
well know what hand it is&mdash;'tis Walter Scott's.'
This was the hand which in the evenings of three
summer weeks wrote the two last volumes of
'Waverley.' Lockhart was introduced to Scott at
a society function in the house of Home Drummond,
of Blair-Drummond, grandson of Lord
Kames. 'Mr. Scott,' he says, 'ever apt to consider
too favourably the literary efforts of others, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
more especially of very young persons, received
me, when I was presented to him, with a cordiality
which I had not been prepared to expect from one
filling a station so exalted. When the ladies retired
from the dinner-table I happened to sit next him,
and he, having heard that I had lately returned
from a tour in Germany, made that country and
its recent literature the subject of some conversation.
He appeared particularly interested when I
described Goethe as I first saw him alighting from
a carriage crammed with wild plants and herbs
which he had picked up in the course of his morning's
botanizing among the hills above Jena.' 'I
am glad,' said he, 'that my old master has pursuits
somewhat akin to my own. I am no botanist,
properly speaking; and though a dweller on the
banks of the Tweed, shall never be knowing about
Flora's beauties; but how I should like to have a
talk with him about trees!'</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, on Scott's initiative,
Lockhart was given the compilation of the historical
part of the 'Edinburgh Annual Register,' worth
£500 a year, plus daily intimacy with Scott&mdash;a
lucky asset for one so young. Apparently, Scott
had taken at once to the younger writer, then only
half his age, and for the next fourteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Lockhart was Scott's right-hand man. No more
fortunate and happy relationship was ever formed.
It was said of Sir Walter's own sons that they left
little record behind them. They fell back into the
common crowd, and perished in the direct line,
leaving no children to carry on his name. But
Lockhart was the son of his heart, his confidant
and faithfullest friend through all the troubles that
followed, and his children were the only heirs of
Abbotsford and their great forebear's glory.</p>

<p class="b1">Of the Edinburgh life, the Castle Street domesticities,
with Lockhart's picture of the 'den,' we are
not now concerned. In October of that same year,
1818, along with Wilson, Lockhart saw Abbotsford
for the first time. Scott was in high feather. The
second of his building schemes had just been completed,
and the famous tower, the cynosure of the
edifice, was his main topic. When his guests rose
from table, he was eager to take them all to the
top for a moonlight view of the valley. Some&mdash;the
more youthful members&mdash;assented, and Scott led
the way up the narrow, dark stairs. 'Nothing
could have been more lovely,' says Lockhart, 'than
the panorama, all the harsher and more naked
features being lost in the delicious moonlight; the
Tweed and the Gala winding and sparkling beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
our feet; and the distant ruins of Melrose appearing
as if carved of alabaster, under the black mass of
the Eildons.' The poet, leaning on his battlement,
seemed to hang over the beautiful vision as if he
had never seen it before. 'If I live,' he exclaimed,
'I will build me a higher tower, with a more
spacious platform, and a staircase better fitted for
an old fellow's scrambling.' Then to John of Skye
(John Bruce), whose pipes were heard retuning on
the lawn beneath, he called for 'Lochaber no more,'
and as the music rose, softened by the distance and
the murmur of the river, Scott crooned what Lockhart
calls the 'melancholy words of the song of
exile.' In the new dining-room, unfinished, but
brilliantly illuminated for the occasion, music and
dance and whisky-punch passed the remainder of
the evening, Scott and Dominie Thomson (a
reputed original of Dominie Sampson) looking on
with gladsome faces, and now and then beating
time, the one with his staff, the other with his
wooden leg. Lord Melville proposed 'good luck'
to the 'roof-tree,' and the whole party, standing in
a circle hand-in-hand, sang joyously:</p>

<p class="ppq20">'Weel may we a' be,<br />
Ill may we never see,<br />
God bless the King and the gude companie!'</p>

<p class="p1">Such was the 'handselling' of the 1818 Abbotsford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Lockhart's next visit (with John Ballantyne), on
April 10, 1819, found Scott still in the grip of his
cramp enemy, and changed in appearance far
beyond what Lockhart was led to expect. In the
night he had a recurrence of his pains, and Lockhart,
naturally, intended to leave next morning.
But Scott, recovered, and wishful to 'drive away
the accursed vapours of the laudanum I was obliged
to swallow last night,' was bent on taking him 'for
a good trot in the open air'&mdash;'up Yarrow'&mdash;the
home phrase, none dearer.</p>

<p class="b1">Past Carterhaugh they rode, where the Forest
waters meet, and where Janet rescued Tamlane
from the fairies; Philiphaugh, Scott describing the
battle as vividly as if he had witnessed it; Newark
where the 'Lay' was chanted; and Slain Men's
Lea, where the Covenanters butchered prisoners
taken under promise of quarter (darkest memory
of Philiphaugh). They saw Minchmoor, too, and
recalled Montrose and his cavaliers scurrying
Tweedwards. Next day they rode across Bowden
Moor, and up the Ale Water to Lilliesleaf and
'ancient Riddell's fair domain,' Scott doing election
business on the way. Next day, again, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
crest of the Eildons Lockhart was shown the
'Kingdom of Border Romance'&mdash;Eildon itself a
not unfitting centre. Between the Lammermoors
and the Cheviots on one side, and from the Merse to
Moffatdale on the other, there is perhaps no range
of landscape more intensely interesting from a
literary point of view, and none in which Lockhart
felt a more personal sympathy. Though not a
Borderer (a measure of Border blood in his veins,
however), the dearest ties of his life were destined
to be with the Border; nor, so long as the English
language lasts, will there be lacking generous
hearts to love and remember the man who had
Sir Walter for friend and hero. As to Irving,
Scott pointed out to Lockhart the more notable
landmarks of the locality and the places connected
with his own career. Sandyknowe he saw, the
home of Scott's boyhood; Earlston, where the
Tower of the Rhymer recalled 'Sir Tristrem,' one
of his early essays in literature; song-haunted
Cowdenknowes; Bemersyde of the perennial Haigs,
'a wizard-spell hanging over it'; Mertoun, where
he penned the 'Eve of St. John'; and Dryburgh,</p>

<p class="ppq20">
'Where with chiming Tweed<br />
The lintwhites sing in chorus';</p>

<p class="p1">and many another spot long famous in popular
song and story. He repeated the lines (often on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

<p class="p1">Lockhart's 'Peter's Letters,'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> published in 1819,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
contains, in some respects, an even better report
of the Abbotsford pilgrimage than the Biography
chapter. 'If I am very partial to the Doctor,'
wrote Scott, acknowledging a gift of the book,
'remember I have been bribed by his kind and
delicate account of his visit to Abbotsford.' Indeed,
as Mr. Lang hints&mdash;and properly&mdash;had
Lockhart never lived to write the Biography, Dr.
Morris's description of Abbotsford would have
remained the <i>locus classicus</i>.</p>

<p>Lockhart was not at Abbotsford again till the
middle of February, 1820. He had not been idle,
however. Of the charms of (Charlotte) Sophia,
Scott's eldest daughter, and dearest, 'the flower and
blossom of his house, and the likest of all his family
to their father,' not much is said, of course, in the
Biography. There is a pretty portrait of her at
Abbotsford as a Norwegian peasant, with a great
hound looking up into her face, in which it is not
difficult to discern Sir Walter's lineaments. But she
exhibited several of the Carpenter characteristics
as well. Sophia was the singing member of the
family. Scott insisted on his children being taught
music, and Scottish music particularly; and the most
delightful evenings of the Abbotsford life were spent
in the Library listening to his daughter's rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the old ballads and songs, and snatches which he
loved with all his heart and soul. Thus, no doubt,
was the 'cold and unimpressionable and unconquerable'
Lockhart pierced to the quick, notwithstanding
a bravado determination 'to continue single.' It
was an ideal love-match, one of the very fortunate
(among many unfortunate) marriages of men of
letters. 'Lockhart is Lockhart,' wrote Scott at a
later period, 'to whom I can most willingly confide
the happiness of the daughter who chose him and
whom he has chosen.' They were married at
Edinburgh (not at Abbotsford) April 29, 1820, by
the incumbent of St. George's Episcopal Church
(where, by the way, the Scotts worshipped), and
took up house at Great King Street, afterwards
removing to 25, Northumberland Street. Chiefswood,
a snug little cottage on the Abbotsford
property&mdash;'bigged in gude greenwood'&mdash;close to
the Rhymer's Glen, within a mile and a half of the
mansion-house, and bordering on Huntlyburn, became
their summer residence. Though somewhat
low-lying, a sweeter scene of seclusion could not
be fancied,&mdash;even yet. Except for an extra gable,
and one or two minor alterations, the place remains
unchanged since the Lockharts' tenancy&mdash;their
truly golden days. For never were they half so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
happy than here. Abbotsford was then at its
acme&mdash;the Wizard at the height of his enchantment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Of Scott's fascination for Chiefswood, Lockhart
has more than one familiar passage. He tells how
with his own hands Scott planted creepers brought
from the old cottage at Abbotsford around its little
rustic porch, and how he was a constant visitor,
glad to escape to its quiet retreat when the stir and
strain of his own guest-crowded castle were too
much for him. Here Scott penned large portions
of the 'Pirate' (his writing-bureau may still be
seen).<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Under the great ash, flourishing yet, on
the slope to the Rhymer's Glen, William Erskine
(afterwards Lord Kinnedder), Scott's most intimate
friend, read aloud chapter after chapter from the
manuscript before the packet was sealed up for the
printer; and here, too, some years later, when
much of the gaiety and splendour of Abbotsford
had vanished, little Johnnie Lockhart&mdash;'Hugh
Littlejohn'&mdash;who, in a sense, had inspired them,
listened to the first narration of those 'Tales of a
Grandfather,' which, it is to be hoped, the children
of Scotland have not left off studying. John Hugh
Lockhart, 'the inheritor of so much genius and
sorrow,' the boy who had Sir Walter to tell him
stories, was a prime favourite with the Chiefswood
circle; the centre of many of its happiest groups;
his grandfather's companion in many rare plantation
raids and riverside rambles. Born in Edinburgh
in 1821, his days were few and evil, however.
Smitten with spine disease, he was barely eleven
when 'God's finger touched him, and he slept.'
Seldom&mdash;hardly ever, indeed&mdash;does Lockhart unburden
his own heart to the reader of the Biography.
But there is one pathetic reverie of the Chiefswood
days which cannot be passed over&mdash;when the crowning
sorrow of his life had come, and he was left to
bemoan her, 'next to Sir Walter himself, the chief
ornament and delight at all those simple meetings,
she to whose love I owed my own place in them&mdash;Scott's
eldest daughter, the one of all his children
who in countenance, mind, and manners most
resembled himself, and who indeed was as like him
in all things as a gentle, innocent woman can ever
be to a great man deeply tried and skilled in the
struggle and perplexities of active life&mdash;she, too, is
no more. But enough&mdash;and more than I intended.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1825 Lockhart left Chiefswood for London.
A curious embassy from the house of Murray had
surprised him in the autumn, in the person of
young Benjamin Disraeli, then a mere tyro in
literature. He came to enlist Lockhart's services
for the <i>Representative</i>, a new daily which Murray
had set his heart on establishing, and, in default of
that, to offer him the editorship of the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>. But to edit, or even to supervise, an
ordinary newspaper, both Scott and Lockhart considered
to be <i>infra dig</i>. There was no difficulty,
however, in accepting the <i>Quarterly</i> appointment,
at a salary which ran to four figures. For
the next dozen years London was Lockhart's
home. Chiefswood was occasionally let&mdash;as, for
instance, to Thomas Hamilton, who wrote there
his dashing military novel of 'Cyril Thornton.'
But for all practical purposes it remained in
Lockhart's hands, he and his family still spending
some pleasant summers and autumns on
Tweedside.</p>

<p class="b1">Of his last summer with Scott the Biography
presents a full account. On April 22, 1831, learning
of Sir Walter's third and more serious seizure,
he sent down Mrs. Lockhart and the children,
arriving himself on May 10. 'I found Sir Walter,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he says, 'to have rallied considerably, yet his
appearance, as I saw him, was the most painful
sight I had ever then seen. All his garments hung
loose about him, his countenance was thin and
haggard, and there was an obvious distortion in
the muscles of one cheek. His look, however, was
placid, his eye bright as ever. He smiled with
the same affectionate gentleness, and though at
first it was not easy to understand anything he
said, he spoke cheerfully and manfully. 'Despite
illness, he was fighting away at 'Count Robert.'
He had planned 'Castle Dangerous,' too, and a
'raid' into Douglasdale. Autumn brought some
slight rallies, when Abbotsford resumed something
of its former brightness. Again, day about, they
dined at Abbotsford and under the trees at Chiefswood.
Once more they had the old excursions&mdash;to
Oakwood and the Linns of Ettrick, and the
twin peels of Sandyknowe and Bemersyde. Very
near the end there came some unexpected things
to cast a 'sunset brilliancy' over Abbotsford&mdash;the
arrival of Major Scott ('a handsomer fellow never
put foot into stirrup'), Captain Burns, son of the
poet, and Wordsworth. Then Scott left for the
Mediterranean, Lockhart's lines ringing in his
ears:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p class="pplq20">'Heaven send the guardian Genius of the vale</p>
<p class="ppli25">Health yet, and strength, and length of honoured days,</p>
<p class="ppli20">To cheer the world with many a gallant tale,</p>
<p class="ppli25">And hear his children's children chant his lays.</p>

<p class="pplq20 p1">'Through seas unruffled may the vessel glide,</p>
<p class="ppli25">That bears her Poet far from Melrose' glen!</p>
<p class="ppli20">And may his pulse be steadfast as our pride,</p>
<p class="ppli25">When happy breezes waft him back again!'</p>

<p class="p1">The rest of the story is well known. Lockhart
did not see him for other eight months&mdash;October
23 to June 13&mdash;but after that, he was
with Scott to the end. There is nothing more
beautiful in the annals of literary friendship than
Lockhart's unwearied solicitude for the dying
Sir Walter. However cold, distant, unemotional,
unknowable, the world may have judged him, here
at any rate we see the real man. At bottom, and
according to those who knew him most intimately,
Lockhart was one of the best of men&mdash;a prince of
good fellows in the truest sense&mdash;above all, though
saying little about it, genuinely and reverently
religious.</p>

<p>In the latter portion of his own life Lockhart
was more or less a martyr to ill-health. For few
men, too, were the fires of affliction more constantly
burning. Friend after friend, on both sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of his house, passed from him. Worst loss of all,
Mrs. Lockhart&mdash;<i>his</i> Charlotte&mdash;was taken, and
then, on the wedding of his daughter, Lockhart
was left a comparatively lonely man, with age
creeping on him and many maladies, in a great
empty house in London. He had many things to
vex him, too, in the 'wild ways of a son whom
he never ceased to love.' In 1847, for the funeral
of the second Sir Walter, he was back at Abbotsford&mdash;the
first time since Scott's death. 'Everything
in perfect order,' he writes, 'every chair and
table where it was then left, and I alone walk a
ghost in a sepulchre amidst the scenes of all that
ever made life worth the name for me.' During the
occupancy of his son-in-law, however, he was often
among the familiar scenes. In 1853 he resigned
his editorship, and, like Scott, spent the following
winter in Italy, returning in April. In August he
was at Milton-Lockhart (where, by the way, much
of the Biography had been written). By the end of
September Abbotsford saw him once more, and for
the last time. His books were brought down from
London, and placed in the new drawing-room,
where they still are. The cheerful breakfast-parlour,
facing the Tweed and Yarrow&mdash;Scott's
sanctum at one period&mdash;was fitted up as his bechamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
as the dining-room had been for Sir
Walter. And there he remained until the end.
'He arrived at Abbotsford,' says Mr. Ornsby's
'Memoirs of James R. Hope Scott,' 'hardly able
to get out of his carriage, and it was at once perceived
that he was a dying man. He desired to
drive about and take leave of various places'&mdash;Chiefswood,
no doubt, Huntlyburn, Torwoodlee,
Ashestiel perhaps, Gladswood, and Dryburgh&mdash;'displaying,
however, a stoical fortitude, and never
making a direct allusion to what was impending....
'He would not suffer anyone to nurse
him till, one night, he fell down on the floor, and
after that, offered no further opposition. Father
Lockhart, a distant cousin, was now telegraphed
for, from whom, during his stay in Rome, he had
received much kind attention, for which he was
always grateful. He did not object to his kinsman's
attendance, though a priest,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and yielded also
when asked to allow his daughter to say a few
prayers by his bedside. Mr. Hope Scott was absent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on business, but returned home one or two days
before the end, which came suddenly'&mdash;no pain,
no struggle, but the falling into a soft sleep like
that of a little child. The date was November 25,
1854. He died at the same age as Scott. As he
desired, he was laid 'at the feet of Walter Scott,'
within hearing of the Tweed. The funeral was
'strictly private.'</p>

<p class="b1">We have said that Lockhart was, at bottom, a
religious man. In company with an Oxford friend
(G. R. Gleig probably) Lockhart used to walk on
Sunday afternoons in Regent's Park. 'With
whatever topic their colloquy began, it invariably
fell off, so to speak, of its own accord into discussions
upon the character and teaching of the
Saviour; upon the influence exercised by both
over the opinions and habits of mankind; upon
the light thrown by them on man's future state
and present destiny. Lockhart was never so
charming as in these discussions. It was evident
that the subject filled his whole mind.' His verses
on Immortality, first published in full in the <i>Scotsman</i>
for 1863, have often been quoted. No
poem probably, not even by Wordsworth or
Tennyson, has done more to inspire and console
the bereaved. Lockhart sent the poem (in part) to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Carlyle, and 'the lines,' says Froude, 'were often
on his lips to the end of his life, and will not be
easily forgotten by anyone who reads them.'</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE LATER ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">Sir Walter's Abbotsford, as we saw, was completed
in 1824. For the next thirty years there
was practically no alteration on the place. At
Scott's death the second Sir Walter came into
possession. He does not appear to have lived at
Abbotsford after 1832, and indeed for many years
previous his time had been spent almost entirely
with his regiment, the 15th Hussars, of which, at
his father's death, he was Major. In 1839, as
Lieutenant-Colonel, he proceeded to Madras, and
subsequently commanded the Hussars in India.
At Bangalore, in August, 1846, having exposed
himself rashly to the sun during a tiger-hunt, he
was smitten with fever, from which he never
recovered. Obliged to return to England, his death
took place on board the <i>Wellesley</i>, near the Cape
of Good Hope, February 8, 1847, in his forty-sixth
year. His widow conveyed his remains to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
this country for interment at Dryburgh Abbey on
May 4 following. Lady Scott&mdash;the pretty 'Jeanie'
Jobson of Lochore,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> as she was affectionately
called by the old people of Ballingry, in which
parish Lochore estate lies&mdash;continued to reside for
the most part in London, and only once visited
Abbotsford. They had no family, which put a
pathetic finis to Scott's most cherished dream.
Lady Scott died at London, March 19,1877, in her
seventy-sixth year, and was buried at Dryburgh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Charles Scott,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> younger son of Sir Walter, 'whose
spotless worth tenderly endeared him to the few
who knew him intimately,' and with whom much
of the Naples pilgrimage was spent, died at
Teheran, October 29, 1841, in his thirty-sixth year.
He was buried there, whither he had gone as
attaché and private secretary to Sir John McNeill,
Commissioner to the Court of Persia. Anne
Scott, the 'Lady Anne' of many delightful
pleasantries (the original of Alice Lee in 'Woodstock'),
Scott's younger daughter, died June 25,
1833, less than a year after her father. A handsome
sarcophagus, still in excellent repair, covers
her remains in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.
Charlotte Sophia Scott&mdash;so named in honour of
a French lady, Sophia Dumergue, who had befriended
the first Lady Scott's mother on her
arrival in England&mdash;wife of John Gibson Lockhart,
died May 17, 1837. Of her two sons, the elder,
John Hugh ('Hugh Littlejohn') died December 15,
1831, and, like his mother and aunt, was interred
at Kensal Green. Walter Scott Lockhart, the
younger, born April 16, 1826, became a Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in the 16th Lancers, and succeeded to Abbotsford
on the death of his uncle in 1847, assuming the
additional surname of Scott. He died, unmarried,
at Versailles, January 10, 1853, and was buried in
the Notre Dame Cemetery there. Charlotte
Harriet Jane, born January 1, 1828, only daughter
of the Lockharts, and granddaughter of Sir Walter
Scott, then came into possession. She was the
wife of James Robert Hope, Q.C., who, on her
succeeding to Abbotsford, also assumed the family
name of Scott. To Mr. Hope Scott and his wife
were born: A boy, who died at birth, 1848;
Walter Michael, born June 2, 1857, died December
11, 1858; Mary Monica, by-and-by heiress of
Abbotsford, born at Tunbridge Wells, October 2,
1852; Margaret Anne, born September 17, 1858,
died December 3 of the same year. Mrs. Hope
Scott died of consumption at Edinburgh,
October 26, 1858, aged thirty. Mr. Hope Scott
married January 7, 1861, as his second wife, Lady
Victoria Alexandrina Fitzalan Howard, eldest
daughter of the fourteenth Duke of Norfolk, by
whom he had two sons: Philip, born April 8, 1868,
who died next day, and James, born December 18,
1870, now M.P. for the Brightside Division of
Sheffield; also four daughters&mdash;Minna Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
born June 6, 1862, wife of Sir Nicholas O'Conor,
G.C.M.G., British Ambassador at Constantinople;
and Catherine, a twin, who died the day of her
birth; Josephine Mary, born May 18, 1864,
married Wilfred Philip Ward, B.A., son of 'Ideal'
Ward of the Oxford Movement, and himself a
well-known writer on ecclesiastical controversies;
Theresa Anne, born September 14, 1865, a
Carmelite nun, who died November 1, 1891.
Lady Victoria died December 20, 1870, aged
thirty, the same age, curiously, as Mr. Hope Scott's
first wife. Mr. Hope Scott himself died April 29,
1873. His remains were laid beside those of
Mrs. Hope Scott and her children in the vaults
of St. Margaret's Convent at Edinburgh, Lady
Victoria and her children being buried at Arundel.</p>

<p>Mary Monica Hope Scott, the sole surviving
descendant of Sir Walter Scott, now succeeded
to the estate, and on July 21, 1874, married the
Hon. Joseph Constable-Maxwell, third son of
William, eleventh Baron Herries of Terregles, and
Marcia, eldest daughter of the Hon. Sir Edward
Marmaduke Vavasour, first Bart., of Hazlewood,
Yorkshire, then Lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade.
Their children are:</p>

<p>1. Walter Joseph, born April 10, 1875, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in the Cameronians. He volunteered for South
Africa, and was in Ladysmith throughout the
siege.</p>

<p>2. Joseph Michael, born May 25, 1880, a Lieutenant
R.N., H.M.S. <i>Dominion</i>.</p>

<p>3. Malcolm Joseph Raphael, born October 22,
1883, Sub-Lieutenant R.N., H.M.S. <i>Pegasus</i>.</p>

<p>4. Herbert Francis Joseph, born March 14, 1891,
a student at Stonyhurst.</p>

<p>5. Mary Josephine, born June 5, 1876; married
(1897) Alexander Dalglish.</p>

<p>6. Alice Mary Josephine, born October 9, 1881;
married (1905) Edward Cassidy of Monasterevan,
County Kildare.</p>

<p>7. Margaret Mary Lucy, born December 13,
1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Robert Hope Scott</span>, who may be styled
the second maker of Abbotsford, was born at
Great Marlow, in Berkshire, July 15, 1812. He
was the third son (not second, as the 'Abridged
Lockhart' has it) of General the Hon. Sir
Alexander Hope of Rankeillour and Luffness,
G.C.B., M.P., sometime Governor of Chelsea
Hospital. His mother was Georgina Alicia,
youngest daughter of George Brown of Elleston,
Roxburghshire. The family of Hope, honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in Scottish history to the present day, is of considerable
antiquity. The name is derived from the
Saxon <i>hop</i> or <i>hope</i>, signifying a sheltered place
among hills. The names of Adam le Hope and
John de Hope appear on the Ragman Roll as
swearing fealty to Edward I. in 1296. Edward
Hope was a leading Edinburgh citizen in Queen
Mary's time. His grandson was the celebrated
King's Advocate, Sir Thomas Hope, of Craighall,
whose great-grandson, again, Charles Hope, of
Hopetoun, became the first Earl of that name.
His son, the second Earl, had for his third wife
Lady Elizabeth Leslie, daughter of the Earl of
Leven and Melville, and of two sons born to
them, the second was General Sir Alexander,
father of James Robert Hope.</p>

<p>Educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford,
young Hope was called to the Bar in 1838, and
specializing as a Parliamentary Counsel, soon
found himself in a large and lucrative practice. On
August 19, 1847, he married Lockhart's daughter.
Her description is that of 'a very attractive person,
with a graceful figure, a sweet and expressive face,
brown eyes of great brilliance, and a beautifully
shaped head. The chin, indeed, was heavy, but
even this added to the interest of the face by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
striking resemblance to the same feature in her
great ancestor, Sir Walter Scott.' There is a
portrait of her at Abbotsford. The following year
Mr. Hope Scott rented Abbotsford from his
brother-in-law, removing thither in August. Five
years after, on the death of the latter, Abbotsford
fell to him as possessor in right of his wife, and for
the remainder of his life it became his principal
residence. The place had been sadly neglected
since Scott's death in 1832, and everything needed
restoration. But the new laird's purse was splendidly
equal to the occasion. He did wonders for
Abbotsford. Between the years 1855 and 1857 he
built a new west wing to the house, consisting of a
Chapel, hall, drawing-room, boudoir, and a suite of
bedrooms. The old kitchen was turned into a
linen-room, and a long range of new kitchen offices
facing the Tweed was erected, which materially
raised the elevation of Scott's edifice, and improved
the appearance of the whole pile as seen from the
river. An ingenious tourist access was also arranged,
with other internal alterations. Outside, the
grounds and gardens were completely overhauled,
the overgrown plantations thinned, and the old
favourite walks cleaned and kept as Scott himself
would have wished. In the lifetime of the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Magician the ground on which he fixed his abode
was nearly on a level with the highway running
along the south front, and wayfarers could survey
the whole domain by looking over the hedge. A
high embankment was now thrown up on the road-front
of Abbotsford, the road itself shifted several
yards back, the avenue lengthened, a lodge built,
and the new mound covered with a choice variety
of timber, which has now grown into one of the
most pleasing features of the Abbotsford approach.
The courtyard was at the same time planted as a
flower-garden, with clipped yews at the corners of
the ornamental grass-plots, and beds all ablaze with
summer flowers. The terraces on the north, so rich
and velvety, date from this period.</p>

<p>These, with much elaborate and costly furnishing
for the new interior, make up the Abbotsford of
to-day. Mr. Hope Scott had not the 'yerd-hunger'
of his illustrious predecessor. His was
rather a 'stone-and-lime mania,' all to most
excellent purpose, however. Most visitors to
Abbotsford have the impression that Sir Walter
was responsible for every part of the present edifice,
whereas it is at least a third larger from that of
Scott's day. From the south, the Hope Scott
addition is easily recognisable, being of light freestone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in contrast to the darker hue of the 1824
pile, which is built of native red whin. The Hope
Scott succession practically rescued Abbotsford
when its fortunes were at their lowest, and its
history almost at a standstill. After sixteen years,
Abbotsford had once more a family life and a
domestic happiness of a singularly exalted type.
Everybody must admit the ideally happy life spent
by Scott himself at Abbotsford&mdash;prior to 1826, at
any rate. Few men enjoyed life more. His
happiness, in the main, sprang from the physical
side of things&mdash;the out-of-doors sports and exercises
in which he revelled, and which were among
the chief attractions of his Abbotsford. Scott was
never happier than when he was making others
happy. No man sacrificed himself more on that
side. And surely that was religion at its reallest.
Scott did not say much about religion. He had, like
Lockhart, all a Scotsman's reticence on the subject.
But that he gave it profound and reverent thought&mdash;that
there was in him a vein of earnest religious
feeling,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> goes without saying, strong man of the
world though he was, and exhibiting, as he did, many
things outré to the ordinary religious sense&mdash;seldom
going to church, for instance, (he read the Church
of England Service-Book, however, to his household);
and 'writing his task' on Sundays more
often than he should.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Hope Scott's happiness, on the other hand,
was the outcome of striking spiritual experiences.
He had always been eminent for piety, and his
views in connection with the Oxford Movement
were well known. In 1851, after anxious deliberation,
he became a Roman Catholic, and was received
on the same day as Cardinal Manning. Shortly
afterwards his wife followed him into the same
communion. Mr. Hope Scott's religion was consequently
a dominating influence at Abbotsford,
permeating, as was said, the whole atmosphere of
the place. 'The impression left by that most
interesting and charming family,' writes a lady
visitor in 1854, 'could never be effaced from my
mind. It always seemed to me the most perfect
type of a really Christian household, such as I
never saw in the world before or since. A religious
atmosphere pervaded the whole house, and not only
the guests, but the servants, must, it seems to me,
have felt its influence. Mr. Hope Scott was the
beau-idéal of an English gentleman, and a Christian.'
There were many guests at the later Abbotsford&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
different order from those of an earlier day.
Hither came John Henry Newman for five weeks
during the winter of 1852-53, and again, for a fortnight,
in 1872. 'We have a Chapel in the house,
but no Chaplain,' wrote Hope Scott to Newman.
'You can say Mass at your own hour, observe
your own ways in everything, and feel all the time
perfectly at home.' Newman replied: 'It would
be a pleasure to spend some time with you; and
then I have ever had the extremest sympathy for
Walter Scott, that it would delight me to see his
place. When he was dying, I was saying prayers
for him continually (whatever they were worth),
thinking of Keble's words, "Think on the Minstrel
as ye kneel."' And, again, we have Newman writing:
'I have ever had such a devotion, I may call it,
to Walter Scott. As a boy, in the early
summer mornings, I read "Waverley" and "Guy
Mannering" in bed, when they first came out,
before it was time to get up; and long before that&mdash;I
think when I was eight years old&mdash;I listened
eagerly to the "Lay of the Last Minstrel," which
my mother and aunt were reading aloud. When
he was dying I was continually thinking of him.
Hope Scott was one of the Cardinal's 'intimates.'
He was also on affectionate terms with Manning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and Gladstone, to the latter of whom he dedicated
his edition of Lockhart's 'Abridgment of the Life.'<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Several passages in Morley's 'Gladstone' show how
strong and genuine was the bond between them.
'Hope especially had influence over me more
than, I think, any other person at any period
of my life. My affection for him during those
latter years before his change was, I may almost
say, intense; there was hardly anything, I think,
which he could have asked me to do, and which I
would not have done.' When Hope Scott joined
the Roman Church, Gladstone, the day after, made
a codicil to his will, striking him out as executor.
Friendship did not die, however, but only lived
'as it lives between those who inhabit separate
worlds.'</p>

<p>A man of great wealth,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Mr. Hope Scott never
spared his means when the interests of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were in question. As an example of his Christian
zeal and affection for Romanism, it may be
stated that he built the Church of Our Lady and
St. Andrew at Galashiels at a cost of £10,000, also
the Chapel at Selkirk, the Church on Loch Shiel,
and the Church of the Immaculate Conception at
Kelso. He helped churches and schools and convents
all over the country. Following his death
in 1873 (Newman preaching his funeral sermon),
Abbotsford went to Mary Monica<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (named from a
favourite saint). So we are thankful that there is
still a Scott&mdash;one of Sir Walter's blood&mdash;his great-granddaughter,
'Lady of Abbotsford.'</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE TREASURES OF ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">Towards the close of his life, at the suggestion of
Cadell (to keep him from more serious tasks), Scott
commenced the writing of a descriptive catalogue
of the most curious articles in his library and
museum&mdash;his 'gabions' he called them. This,
which he entitled 'Reliquiæ Trottcosianæ&mdash;or the
Gabions of the late Jonathan Oldbuck, Esq.,'&mdash;thus
assuming to himself some claim to be the
original of the inimitable Laird of Monkbarns&mdash;was,
unfortunately, never finished. The MS. is at
Abbotsford, and has been partly printed in <i>Harper's
Magazine</i> for April, 1889. As the writing shows,
it is first in Scott's own hand, sadly cramped and
shaky; then Laidlaw takes up the pen, but the
work was soon abandoned for 'Count Robert,' the
romance that was simmering in his brain. It is a
thousand pities that Scott preferred 'Count Robert'
to the gabions history. His mind, impaired by
repeated shocks of paralysis, was quite unfitted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
serious imaginative composition. Even the 'Reliquiæ'
fragment is not without proof of waning
power. Still, 'Count Robert' could well have been
spared for the completion of the latter project, and
none but the Wizard himself, with his rare wealth
of anecdote and story, could have done it justice.</p>

<p>Of the many haunts of genius in this and other
countries, Abbotsford is unique in that it was the
first (and likely to be the last) great estate won by
the pen of an author. Created practically within a
dozen years&mdash;a marvellously brief period&mdash;it remains
(the Hope Scott extension excepted) very much as
in Sir Walter's lifetime. His own house has undergone
no change beyond slight and necessary rearrangement
of the furnishings. The visitor of
to-day may rest assured that he sees the place
almost identically as Scott saw it. The apartments
open to the public were planned by him to the
minutest particular. His eyes fell on these same
pictures, with very few exceptions. And of its
antiquarian treasures&mdash;the most remarkable private
collection in existence&mdash;almost all have personal
association with Scott.</p>

<p>There are two methods of reaching Abbotsford&mdash;by
rail to Galashiels, thence to Abbotsford Ferry
Station on the Selkirk line, alighting at which and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
crossing the Tweed, a delightful tree-shaded walk of
about a mile brings us to the house. But the more
popular method is to make the journey from Melrose,
three miles distant. The way lies between delicious
green fields and bits of woodland&mdash;a pleasant
country road, exposed somewhat, despite smiling
hedgerows on either side. Seldom in summer is it
without being dust-blown. For in a more than local
sense, this is one of the world's highways, with a constant
stream of pilgrims from every land passing to
and fro. No better proof, surely, of Scott's abiding
popularity. The road teems with reminiscences of
the Romancist. Out from the grey town, with its
orchards and picturesque gardens, the Waverley
Hydropathic is passed on the right. In the grounds
a handsome seated statue of Scott may be noticed.
Further on, to the left, tree-ensconced, lie Chiefswood
and Huntlyburn on the Abbotsford estate.
Then comes Darnick, with its fine peel, now open
to the public, and well worth a visit. At the fork
of the roads (that to the right leading by Melrose
Bridge to Gattonside and Galashiels) we turn leftwards,
and are soon at the visitors' entrance (a
modest wicket-gate) to the great Scottish Mecca.
But nothing is to be seen yet. Mr. Hope Scott's
plantations and 'ingenious tourist arrangement'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
screen the pile with wonderful completeness. And
it is only when within a few paces of the building,
at a turn in the lane leading from the highway, that
all at once one emerges upon it. The public
waiting-room is in the basement, whence parties of
ten or twelve are conducted through the house.</p>

<p>In point of picturesqueness, Abbotsford is, of
course, best seen from the Tweed&mdash;the north bank&mdash;or
the hillside, whereon the Galashiels manufacturers
have reared their own princely residences&mdash;unknown
to Scott's day. But we are then looking, let us
remember, at the <i>back</i> of the edifice. Nearly all
the photographs present this view, however, for the
sake of the river. The situation is low&mdash;poor,
indeed, except for the Tweed. At first not unfrequently
is there a sense of disappointment,
especially if one's ideas have been founded on
Turner's somewhat fanciful sketches. These, it
need scarcely be said, though beautiful, and art
at its highest, are yet far removed (like his Sandyknowe
and Chiefswood) from the real Abbotsford.</p>

<p>In his lifetime Scott's friends had no end of praise
and flattery for the place: 'A perfect picture of the
wonderful owner's mind'; 'a romance in stone
and lime'; 'a poem in stone'; 'a mosaic of Scottish
history'; 'like places that we dream about'; 'exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
what one ought to have had wit enough to
dream,' etc. It is surprising, therefore, to have the
more modern descriptions of such men as Dr. John
Brown, who actually calls it the 'ugly Abbotsford';
Ruskin, albeit a true Scott-lover, who describes it
as 'perhaps the most incongruous pile that gentlemanly
modernism ever designed'; Hugh Miller,
who characterizes it as a 'supremely melancholy
place'; Dean Stanley, who (curiously) speaks of it
as 'a place to see once <i>but never again</i>'; George
Gilfillan, who compares it to a 'Castle Folly';
Robert Chambers, to whom it was chiefly a 'sad
piece of patchwork'; and Carlyle (never friendly to
Scott), who simply refers to it as 'a stone house in
Selkirkshire.' [It is not in Selkirkshire, however.]
Granting it to be in many respects bewildering,
heterogeneous, irregular, fantastic, odd, a revelry of
false Gothic, reared on no set plan, and so forth,
the general effect does not seem to be at all displeasing.
Ruskin and the others saw Abbotsford
perhaps only once at the most. But it is not a
place to be exhausted in an hour, or a day, and
hundreds (among modern trippers) in their hurry
can hardly carry away a correct impression.
Abbotsford is a place to be seen often, and the
oftener it is seen and studied, the more fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
will it become, and the less prominent will its
defects appear.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill243" id="ill243"></a>243</p>

<p class="ppn20 p1">'Thou gav'st him solemn thoughts at twilight dim,<br />
And now to us dost bear remembrance sweet of him.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Abbotsford proper is enclosed by an embattled
wall and a fine castellated gateway, surmounted
by a sculptured portcullis with Scott's motto,
'<span class="smcap">Clausus tutus ero</span>,' an anagram of his name
in Latin. The 'jougs' (stocks for the neck) of
Threave Castle dangle to the left of the handsome
iron-clenched door. Entering, we are in the courtyard,
half an acre or so in extent, nicely turfed
and parterred. It is walled on two sides, and on
the third, facing the entrance, an elegant stone
screen of sixteen elliptic arches, set with iron
lattice-work, separates from the gardens. The
fourth side is the house-front, 150 feet in length.
All the grounds are kept in the pink of perfection.
The antiquarian character of the place is at once
apparent. Medallions, tablets, altars, etc., from the
Roman station at Petreia (Penrith) and elsewhere,
fill numerous niches in the courtyard wall, against
which runs a trellised arbour covered with creepers.
The centre of the courtyard is occupied by a
fountain, which is said to have stood in former
days at the foot of the Cross of Edinburgh (see
Lockhart, vol. v., p. 261). The dial-stone in the
flower-garden, inscribed (like Johnson's watch) with
the motto 'ΓΑΡ ΝΥΞ ΕΡΧΕΤΑΙ' ('For the night
cometh'), is an object of suggestive interest.
'Turn-Again' is in the corner, recalling Scott's
first introduction to Abbotsford. Across the archway
leading into the fruit-garden there is the
appropriate text:</p>

<p class="pbq center">'<i>Et audiverunt Vocem Domini deambulantis
in horto.</i>'</p>

<p class="pn p1">Within, and guarded with jealous care, is the last
survivor of the fruit-trees planted by Sir Walter
himself.</p>

<p class="b1">The exterior of Abbotsford abounds in relics and
inscriptions, woven here and there throughout the
masonry. At the western side of the main entrance,
and high up in the wall, is the door of the old
'Heart of Midlothian' (see p. 37), with the words:</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="smcap gesperrt">'The Lord of Armis is my protector:
Blissit ar thay that trust in the Lord,
1575.</span>'</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The arched entrance-porch was copied from
Linlithgow Palace. The arms of the family with
the legends&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn center">'REPARABIT CORNUA PHŒBE; WATCH WEEL'</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">are conspicuous above it. Near by are the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and stone effigy (cut by Smith of Darnick) of
Maida, Scott's favourite deerhound, with Lockhart's
famous 'false-quantity' lines:</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">
'Maidæ Marmoreâ dormis sub imagine Maida<br />
ad januam domini sit tibi terra levis,'</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">thus Englished by Sir Walter:</p>

<p class="ppq20">
'Beneath the sculptured form which late you wore,<br />
Sleep soundly, Maida, at your master's door."</p>
<p class="pn50 reduct">(See Lockhart, vol. vii., pp. 275-281.)</p>

<p class="p1 b1">There is apparently only one date, 1822, on the
south front, on a stone below the staircase window.
Eastward is the Study, with Scott's bedroom above,
and the tower from which he looked out on the
Eildons. A long stone near the visitors' entrance
carries the inscription:</p>

<p class="pbqq05">
'By Night by Day Remember ay the goodness of ye Lord:<br />
And thank His name whos glorious fam is spred Throughout ye world';</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">whilst another, showing a rudely-carved sword,
has the words:</p>

<p class="ppq30">'Up with ye Sutors of Selkyrke.'</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Over the great bay-window of the Library, the
first of the principal rooms facing the Tweed, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
lintel from the Common Hall of the old Edinburgh
College, with a quotation from Seneca:</p>

<p class="pbqr">'Virtus Rectorem Ducemque
Desiderat; Vitia&mdash;sine&mdash;Magistro
Discuntur.' Anno 1616.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">Next the Library is the Drawing-Room, then the
Armoury, and Dining-Room, with the motto:</p>

<p class="pn center lmid">'SO<br />
LI DEO<br />
GLORIA.'</p>

<p class="pn p1">And, lastly, the Breakfast Parlour, once Scott's
sanctum, in which Lockhart died.</p>

<p>Now turn we to the interior. Be it at once said
that Mrs. Maxwell Scott's excellent little 'Catalogue
of the Armour and Antiquities at Abbotsford'
is absolutely indispensable. A previous study
of its pages will enable the visitor to know exactly
how he is to be piloted, and the whereabouts of
the 'gabions' he is most bent on seeing. The
attendants are always ready to point out objects
of special interest to individuals, and there need be
no hesitancy to ask questions. For the sake of
convenience, we follow the order which has been
in force for years. All we plead for in the public
interest is a little more leisure, if that be possible,
for seeing what is to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Visitors are admitted first into what is surely the
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of the place&mdash;</p>


<p class="pn center p1 mid"><span class="smcap">The Study.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">This is a fair-sized apartment, 20 feet long, 14 feet
broad, and 16 feet high, lighted by a large window
which looks out to the courtyard. Everything is
practically as Scott left it. Oaken bookcases line
the walls, and hardly a volume (it is chiefly a
reference library) has been altered. A light gallery,
graced with ample book-shelves, runs round three
sides of the room, opening out on a private staircase,
by which the 'inhabitant of the study,' as the
'Reliquiæ' puts it, 'if unwilling to be surprised by
visitors, may make his retreat, a facility which he
has sometimes found extremely convenient.' The
Desk is, of course, the chief object of interest.
Modelled from one at Rokeby (see 'Letters,' vol. i.,
p. 180), it is thus described by Lockhart as he first
saw it in the 'den' at Castle Street in 1818:</p>

<p>'The only table was a massive piece of furniture
with a desk and all its appurtenances on either
side, that an amanuensis might work opposite to
him when he chose, and with small tiers of drawers
reaching all round to the floor. The top displayed
a goodly array of session papers, and on the desk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
below were, besides the MS. at which he was
working, sundry parcels of letters, proof-sheets, and
so forth, all neatly done up in red tape. His own
writing apparatus was a very handsome old box,
richly covered, lined with crimson velvet, and containing
ink-bottles, taper-stand, etc., in silver, the
whole in such order that it might have come from
the silversmith's window half an hour before.' At
the desk most of the novels were written, we may
suppose, though not all at Abbotsford, as is not
unfrequently imagined. It is, however, impossible
to collate with exactness the dates and occasions
of their composition. The fact remains, that in all
probability each of the Waverleys was penned at
this desk. Hence its unreckonable value to the
literary pilgrim, and the unqualified reverence with
which tens of thousands have gazed upon it. Certainly
no article of furniture has been so intimately
associated with Scott. Fourteen years from the
time that he first saw it, it fell to Lockhart himself
to open Scott's desk under the mournfullest circumstances.
'Perhaps the most touching evidence
of the lasting tenderness of Sir Walter's early
domestic feelings was exhibited to his executors
when they opened his repositories in search of his
testament the evening after his burial. On lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
up his desk we found, arranged in careful order,
a series of little objects which had obviously been
so placed there that his eye might rest on them
every morning before he began his tasks. These
were the old-fashioned boxes that had garnished
his mother's toilette when he, a sickly child, slept
in her dressing-room&mdash;the silver taper-stand, which
the young advocate had bought for her with his
first five-guinea fee; a row of small packets, inscribed
with her hand, and containing the hair of
those of her offspring who had died before her;
his father's snuff-box and etui case, and more
things of the like sort, recalling "the old familiar
faces."'</p>

<p>Scott's desk is seldom seen open. The present
writer counts it one of the memories of his life to
have had that pleasure, and to have sat in Sir
Walter's 'own huge elbow-chair,' and to have
handled&mdash;an act almost too sacred after all those
years&mdash;relics so touching and pathetic in their
associations. The little locks of hair are still there,
with the quills used by Scott, and his spectacles,
pocket-knife, paper-knife, and a large number of
account-books and other private documents. Here,
too, is Mrs. Lockhart's Bible 'From J. G. L.,
1825,' her Prayer-Book, and a host of articles with
which both Scott and Lockhart must have been
long familiar.</p>

<p class="p1">A small turret-room off the study is of peculiar
interest. Sir Walter styled it his 'Speak-a-bit.'
Here he enjoyed many a happy <i>tête-à-tête</i>. It is said
to be panelled with the oak of the bedstead on which
Queen Mary slept at Jedburgh in 1566. Scott's
death-mask is the only article the room contains.
The dead face is so tired that nobody can look
upon it without a gush of pity, and a feeling of
thankfulness that at last the man is in his grave.
We are not moved by the grandeur of its modelling;
the appeal it makes is to a larger humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
than that. It is the face of a brother man,
stretched out too long upon the rack of this tough
world. The majesty of the forehead, and the dour
earnestness of the features, tell of Walter Scott,
the genius; but it is in the corners of the mouth
that all the pathos lies. In them there is the
droop of an infinite weariness, and it makes the
heart ache (see <i>Temple Bar</i>, 1904).</p>

<p class="pn center p1 mid"><span class="smcap">Library.</span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Adjoining is the Library, the largest and finest
apartment in the house&mdash;40 feet long by 18 feet
broad and 16 feet high&mdash;with an immense bay-window,
commanding a lovely view of the Tweed.
The book-presses, wired and locked, rise to a height
of 11 feet, leaving a space of 5 feet accordingly
between the top of the shelves and the magnificent
cedar ceiling, whose rich Gothic ornamentation
(of plaster, however) is modelled from Melrose
and Rosslyn. Notice the familiar 'curly green'
of the Melrose Abbots. Close on 20,000 volumes
line the walls.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Many are presentation copies, and
not a few contain MS. criticisms and jottings
by Scott. The furniture of this room is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
valuable. Two very richly-carved chairs, said to
have come from the Borghese Palace, in Rome,
were presented by Constable (see letter to Terry
in Lockhart, vol. vii., p. 104). An ebony
writing-cabinet, gorgeously figured, and once the
property of George III., was presented by his
successor. Note should be taken of Sir Walter's
four-sloped reading-desk, movable at the will of the
writer, thus enabling him to consult a number of
works at one time. This was in constant use
when 'Napoleon' was on the stocks. The great
centre-table was the work of Joseph Shillinglaw,
Darnick, 'the Sheriff planning and studying every
turn as zealously as ever an old lady pondered
the development of an embroidered cushion.' The
hangings and curtains (not in use) were chiefly
the work of a little hunch-backed tailor, William
Goodfellow, who occupied a cottage on Scott's
farm of the Broomielees. 'Not long after he
had completed his work at Abbotsford,' says
Lockhart, 'little Goodfellow fell sick, and as his
cabin was near Chiefswood, I had many opportunities
of observing the Sheriff's kind attention to
him in his affliction. I can never forget the evening
on which the poor tailor died. When Scott
entered he found everyone silent, and inferred from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the looks of the good women in attendance that
their patient had fallen asleep, and that they feared
his sleep was the final one. He murmured some
syllables of kind regret. At the sound of his voice
the dying tailor unclosed his eyes, and eagerly and
wistfully sat up, clasping his hands with an expression
of rapturous gratefulness and devotion
that, in the midst of deformity, disease, pain and
wretchedness, was at once beautiful and sublime.
He cried with a loud voice, "The Lord bless and
reward you!" and expired with the effort.' One
painting only has place in the Library&mdash;a full-length
of the second Sir Walter, by Sir William
Allan (1822), in the uniform of the 15th Hussars,
his horse by his side. 'A handsomer fellow never
put foot into stirrup,' said Scott. The celebrated
Chantrey Bust, of which Lockhart said that it
'alone preserved for posterity the cast of expression
most fondly remembered by all who mingled in his
domestic circle,' was placed in its present niche (at
the end of the room) by young Sir Walter the day
after his father's funeral. Scott sat to Sir Francis
Chantrey in 1820, and it is this original bust which
is at Abbotsford. Only one duplicate was made
(for Apsley House). Chantrey sculptured a <i>second</i>
bust in 1828 (acquired by Sir Robert Peel), having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in the meantime presented Scott with the bust of
1820, which bears an inscription to that effect on
the back.</p>

<p>A large octagonal glass table in the fine bay
contains the following gabions:</p>

<p class="pn">Napoleon's blotter and gold bee-clasps.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Found in his carriage after Waterloo. The blotter
contains a small packet of Napoleon's hair.</p>

of 'Rob Roy.'</p>

<p class="pn">Helen MacGregor's brooch.</p>

<p class="pbq30">A six-pointed star, with a thistle and two leaves
between. 'I confess, for my own part,' says Scott,
'that I looked long and curiously upon the brooch
that belonged to Rob Roy's wife. I was thinking
more of the wife than of the dauntless outlaw; of
the woman who reproached her husband upon his
deathbed for exhibiting some signs of contrition
for his past misdeeds, exhorting him to die as he
had lived, "like a man."'</p>

<p class="pn">Flora MacDonald's pocket-book.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Presented by Alexander Campbell, Leith, 1825.
Flora, it would appear, had intended this as a
present to the Rev. Martin Martin, a minister in
the Isle of Skye, but he having died, it never
reached its destination. The initials 'M. M.' have
been wrought on the outside.</p>

Caesar,'&mdash;Scott to Lockhart.</p>

Burns met only once, in 1786.</p>

interesting apartment, 24 feet by 18 feet, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
height the same as the others. The walls are
hung with Chinese paper (wonderfully fresh still),
evidence of that Chinese fashion which the skill of
Sir William Chambers succeeded in foisting upon
fashionable people during the reign of George IV.
The windows, doors, and other woodwork, are of
Jamaica cedar, and have a rich and beautiful
appearance, and the furnishings are of great value.
Notice some very pretty china specimens. The
paintings, both numerous and valuable, include:</p>

<p class="pn p1">Full-length portrait of Scott, by Sir Henry Raeburn,
R.A.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Painted in 1809. A replica, with variations, of
the picture done for Constable the year before

of Liddesdale. Camp is the dog at Scott's feet,
and Douglas the greyhound.</p>

<p class="pn">Head of Mary Queen of Scots, by Amyas Cawood
(not Camwood, or Canwood, as the guidebooks
say).</p>

<p class="pbq30">Presented by a Prussian nobleman. This picture
represents the head of the Queen after decapitation,
and bears the signature of the painter, with
the inscription and date, 'Maria Scotiæ Regina,
Feb. 9, 1587,' the day after the execution. 'It
is known that leave was granted for such a picture,
and in the painter's name we may probably recognize
a brother of Mary's faithful attendant, Margaret
Cawood,' Cawood, or, as now, Carwood, near
Biggar, was the seat of this family.</p>

<p class="pn">Fast Castle.</p>

<p class="pn p1">'Stepping westwards,' we enter the Armoury,
a long, narrow apartment, running right across
the house, with emblazoned windows at either end
(heads of the Scottish Kings), and forming a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of ante-room to the drawing-room on one side
and the dining-room on the other. It consists of
two parts, that to the south being 10 feet in
length, the other 25 feet. Both portions communicate
by a Gothic archway, with carved oaken
wicket. Scarcely a nation on earth, savage or
civilized, but has contributed something in the
shape of a warlike weapon to the stores of the
Abbotsford armoury. Of its many remarkable
and valuable objects&mdash;the mere enumeration of
which would, of themselves, form a goodly catalogue&mdash;the
following may be specially noted:</p>

<p class="pn p1">Sword of Montrose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="pbqn30">'I have a relic of a more heroic character; it
is a sword which was given to the great Marquis
of Montrose by Charles I., and appears to have
belonged to his father, our gentle King Jamie.
It had been preserved for a long time at Gartmore,
but the present proprietor was selling his
library, and John Ballantyne, the purchaser, wishing
to oblige me, would not conclude a bargain
till he flung the sword into the scale' (letter
to Joanna Baillie, Lockhart, vol. iii., p. 390).
The sword bears on both sides the royal arms of
Great Britain, with the following inscription on
the blade:</p>

<p class="ppq35">'Jacobe alumne pacis atk pallæ<br />
Serene cultor et decus Britannici<br />
Clarrissimum regni tuis regalib<br />
Sceptris subest de stirpe quond martia.'</p>

<p class="pbq30">Scott had the sheath remounted in 1822.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn">Rob Roy's gun.</p>

<p class="pbq30">An immensely long-barrelled weapon of Spanish
manufacture, bearing the initials of the freebooter,
'R. M. C.'&mdash;Robert Macgregor Campbell (see Introduction
to 'Rob Roy,' p. 87). 'A dialogue between
Montrose's sword and Rob Roy's gun might be
composed with good effect' (Scott to Joanna
Baillie).</p>

<p class="pn">Rob Roy's sword.</p>

<p class="pn">Peter Mathieson, with 'Donald,' the pony.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Coachman. 'I cannot forget how his eyes sparkled
when he first pointed out to me Peter Mathieson
guiding the plough on the haugh. "Egad," said
he, "auld Pepe" (this was the children's name
for their good friend)&mdash;"auld Pepe's whistling at
his darg. The honest fellow said a yoking in a
deep field would do baith him and the blackies
good. If things get round with me, easy shall be
Pepe's cushion"' (Lockhart, vol. ix.). Painter
uncertain; initialled 'G. D.'; date 1851.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Described in 'Redgauntlet' (see Lockhart, vol. vi.,

<p class="pn">James Ballantyne.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Painter unknown. 'James was a short, stout, well-made
man, and would have been considered a
handsome one but for those grotesque frowns,
starts, and twistings of his features, set off by a
certain mock majesty of walk and gesture, which
he had perhaps contracted from his usual companions,
the emperors and tyrants of the stage.'</p>

<p class="pbq30">'The man who played the Bailie made a piece of
acting equal to whatever has been seen in the

electrified by the truth, spirit, and humour which
he threw into the part. It was the living Nicol
Jarvie' (Scott to Terry, April, 1829).</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">In this order of going round the Entrance Hall
comes last&mdash;a spacious apartment, 40 feet by
20 feet, panelled to the height of 7 feet with dark
oak from Dunfermline Abbey. The roof is of
stucco-work in imitation of the wainscotting, and
comprehends a series of arches with dependent
points, modelled from Melrose Abbey. The effect
of this room is grand and impressive. A sort of
rich and red twilight, even at noonday, from the
emblazoned 'Bellenden'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> windows, pervades the
place, which is literally laden with relics and
trophies. The cornice displays a double line of
escutcheons, with the heraldic bearings of the
Scotts, Kers, Elliots, Douglases, Homes, Pringles,
Maxwells, Johnstones, Chisholms, and other Border
families, and the inscription in black letter:</p>

<p class="pbq">'These be the Coat Armouris of ye Clannis
and men of name quha keepit the Scottish
Marches in ye days of auld. They were worthie
in thair tyme and in thair defens God thaim

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The arms of Scott's own ancestors occupy
sixteen shields running along the centre of the
roof, being the complete quarterings of a man of
'gentle blood.' On his father's side&mdash;running west&mdash;are
the names of Scott, Haliburton, Campbell,
M'Dougal, Murray, Scott (Dryhope), Ker, Riddel;
and on his mother's side&mdash;running east&mdash;Rutherford,
Swinton, Shaw, Ker, Ainslie. Three shields
on this side are blanks,&mdash;Scott not being able to
trace out his pedigree to the full length of his
spaces,&mdash;and are painted over with blue clouds,
and the motto, <i>Alta&mdash;Nox&mdash;Premit</i> ('Oblivion has
covered them'). The floor is a mosaic of black
and white Hebridean marble. Of a singularly rich
assortment of curiosities in the shape of cuirasses
and suits of armour, helmets, shields, swords, lances,
and other arms of all sorts and ages, flags, cannonballs,
and numberless other articles from apparently
every country under the sun, all of them interesting
in their antiquity or associations, the following are
some of the more notable:</p>

<p class="pn p1">Suit of fluted armour.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Early sixteenth century.</p>

<p class="pn">Suit of polished steel tilting armour.</p>

<p class="pbq30">Middle of the sixteenth century. Believed to
have come from Bosworth Field, and, as Scott
suggests, to have belonged to Sir John Cheney,
the biggest man of both armies on that memorable
day. An enormous two-handed sword, nearly the
length of a man, is held by this figure (see also
the celebrated Calendar-sword, close by, and tilting-lance,
about 12 feet long).</p>

the fact that Italy has a box with similar claims in

at Abbotsford has not the spring lock.</p>

which seemed to be tumbled and bent and broken

care was expended on its design and decoration.
He adorned the walls with portraits of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">AROUND ABBOTSFORD</p>

<p class="pn p1">Whilst this work deals mainly with Abbotsford,
it will be fitting to refer briefly to one or two places
within what may be called the Abbotsford radius.
At least half a dozen scenes of interest can be
visited with profit by the literary pilgrim. Abbotsford
is his Mecca <i>par excellence</i>, and it is here that
homage must rise to its full height. Abbotsford
is but the centre, however, of a widely historic
locality, in which it may be possible to discover
shrine after shrine, each demanding some show of
devotion. Of course, Scott is the chief attractive
force to the Scottish Border. But long before his
day Tweedside and the country around Abbotsford
lay in the very lap of 'glamourie.' And it
was, as we have seen, largely because of the
romance which haunted the whole district that
Abbotsford took shape, to become by-and-by
perhaps the most romantic spot in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">Melrose&mdash;the Kennaquhair of the 'Monastery'&mdash;is
the most convenient headquarters for studying
the homes and following the footprints of Sir
Walter Scott. Scott may be said to have made
Melrose. It was a mere village when Abbotsford
was building. It really grew with the
growth of Abbotsford, and in the wake of Scott's
success. The name&mdash;<i>maol-ros</i>, 'the open or naked
headland'&mdash;is a transfer from Old Melrose,
two and a half miles further down the Tweed,
where flourished the first monastic settlement,
fragrant with the memories of Aidan, Boisil
(whence St. Lessuden and St. Boswells), and most
celebrated of them all, Cuthbert, that Leaderside
shepherd lad, who rose to be head of the great
See of Durham. It was David, 'the Sair Sanct,'
who founded the second religious house of Melrose
between the years 1136 and 1146. Dedicated to
the Virgin, and tenanted by a colony of Cistercians
from Rievalle, in Yorkshire, the pioneers of their
Order in Scotland, Melrose quickly came to the
front as the most famous establishment of its kind
in the kingdom. For four centuries, like the rest
of the Border Abbeys, Melrose held its place, and
was a power in the land. During the Edwardian
Wars it suffered frequently from fire and assault,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and, indeed, about 1322, it was more or less a ruin.
Mainly through the munificence of Robert the
Bruce, it was rebuilt in 1326, 'in the most magnificent
style of the period,' at a cost of £50,000 in
modern money. By 1384 it was again sacked, this
time by Richard II., and again restored. In 1544
Evers and Latoun, the English generals at Ancrum
Moor, desecrated and demolished the Douglas
tombs at Melrose, and in the following year, on
the Hertford invasion, the work of destruction
was complete. At the Reformation the Abbey
was finally dismantled, and for long afterwards
the ruin was used as a quarry by the towns-people.
Not a little of the original Abbotsford
found its way from Melrose Abbey. The statues,
specially numerous and costly, were 'ground to
powder' in 1649, and up to 1820 the nave was
used as the parish church. Scott's genius and
patriotism have done more for Melrose than anything
else. To him, in large measure, as the
Biography shows, the place owes its preservation
as the finest ecclesiastical ruin in the country. None
knew Melrose Abbey better, or bore a dearer
regard to it, than Scott, and its architecture is
nowhere more faithfully described than in the
'Lay.' To read the 'Lay' at Melrose is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the delights of a lifetime. The best view is from
the south-east corner of the churchyard. By the
high altar Bruce's heart was interred. Here also
lie the bodies of the brave Earl Douglas, hero
of Otterburn, and of that other Douglas, the
'dark knight of Liddesdale,' a prominent figure
in Border story. There, too, is the traditional
grave of 'the wondrous Wizard,' Michael Scot,
from whose cold dead hand Deloraine snatched
the Book of Might. And many another&mdash;monarch
and monk, priest and warrior, Border
laird and lady&mdash;are at rest under these time-worn
canopies. How interesting and touching to follow
the inscriptions around the walls, and the numerous
chaste carvings on 'pillar and arch and lintel high.'
Two epitaphs outside call for attention, both connected
with Scott. One, which he was fond of
repeating&mdash;it is surely one of the most pregnant
in epitaphian literature&mdash;runs:</p>

<p class="ppiq25">'The earth goeth on the earth,<br />
Glist'ring like gold;</p>
<p class="ppi25">The earth goes to the earth<br />
Sooner than it wold;</p>
<p class="ppi25">The earth builds on the earth<br />
Castles and towers;</p>
<p class="ppi25">The earth says to the earth,<br />
"All shall be ours."'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn p1">The other, his own simple and sincere words,
covering the grave of honest Tom Purdie:</p>

<p class="p1">Close under the Abbey windows reposes all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that is mortal of the great Christian philosopher,
Sir David Brewster. 'The Lord is my Light' is a
not unfitting text for one who was the acknowledged
master of optics in his day. Melrose Cross,
in the centre of the town, with the date of its
restoration (1642), is believed to be the oldest
'mercat-cross' in the Borders. From Melrose we
may climb the clefted Eildons, always in vision,
the supreme landmarks and sentinels of the Borderland.
Here Scott loved to linger. 'I can stand
on the Eildon Hill,' he said, 'and point out forty-three
places famous in war and verse.' Or the
romantic green-woods of the Fairy Dean may
attract us, despite the 'White Lady' and her
vagaries. And we may be led to explore Elwyndale
and the fine open country to the head of the
glen, with the three towers of the 'Monastery,'
Hillslap or Glendearg&mdash;Dame Glendinning's home&mdash;Langshaw,
and Colmslie.</p>

<p class="b1">As a rule, the visitor to Abbotsford has also
Dryburgh as an objective, and ample provision has
been made for his ease and comfort in getting
thither. By far the most picturesque route is to
follow that of Scott's funeral-day. Past Newstead
first, quaintest of old-world hamlets, the supposed
Roman Trimontium (from the Eildons, at whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
base it nestles). Note its wealth of sun-dials.
Thence, still keeping by the serpentine Tweed, to
Leaderfoot, across its old Bridge&mdash;where was
Scott's last passing of the Tweed&mdash;up by Gladswood
and Bemersyde Hill, pausing for a moment
or two at 'Sir Walter's gate,' on the crest of the
whinny road&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq20">
'Where fair Tweed flows round holy Melrose,<br />
And Eildon slopes to the plain.'</p>

<p class="p1">This was Scott's favourite view, and it has few
equals. Did not Elihu Burritt affirm that 'it is
the most magnificent view I ever saw in Scotland,
excepting, perhaps, the one from Stirling Castle'?
Still pursuing our way Dryburghwards, we catch
a glimpse of Sandyknowe<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to the east, the scene of
Scott's child-years, and enshrined in some of the
noblest verse of 'Marmion.' Then, dipping down
through the thickest and tallest of wild-woods, and
the most luxuriant of bracken and broom, we
reach Dryburgh, which, if it cannot boast the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
architectural glories of Melrose, far surpasses it
for queenly situation. Surrounded on three sides
by the Tweed, itself unseen from the Abbey
precincts, and amidst a 'brotherhood of venerable
trees,' in picturesqueness and seclusion it is perhaps
the most charming monastic ruin in Great
Britain. And here, in the lap of legends old, in
the heart of the land he has made enchanted, and
among his ancestral dust (for Dryburgh belonged
to his forebears, and might have come to himself but
for the stupidity of a spendthrift relative), Walter
Scott waits the breaking light of morn. There are
the inscriptions which we must read, and as reverent
and worshipful pilgrims, heads are bared for this
sacred duty. In 1847 a massive granite sarcophagus
was placed over Scott's grave, where
thousands upon thousands from all the winds that
blow have treasured its simple words:</p>

<p class="pn center p1">

<p class="p1">If we be wise, we shall make the return journey
by Dryburgh village and Newtown. What a
magnificent river the Tweed is here, looking either
up or down from the Baillie Suspension Bridge,
or the high red bank beyond! Surely the Eildons
never backgrounded a pleasanter picture than this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
All the landscape is, in sooth, among the fairest
of fair scenes, on which we shall want to feast
the eye again and again, to be dreaming of Dryburgh
when, it may be, over the seas and far away.
On a summer's day, or at the early autumn, or
even 'mid winter's mantling white, it seems to
carry a perpetual charm.</p>

<p>Kelso, as a shrine of Scott, may not be left
unvisited. Here he was schooled (partly), but
better, it was at Kelso that the whole world of
Romance opened out to his delighted fancy.
Robert Burns is said to have gazed in wondrous
and even prayerful rapture on the vision of Kelso
Bridge and the Tweed, forming an almost perfect
picture. And this, with the Abbey, 'like some
antique Titan predominating over the dwarfs
of a later world'; ruined Roxburgh, between
Tweed's and Teviot's flow; and the near neighbourhood
of other memory-moving spots, were just the
scenes which made the best appeal to Scott, which
influenced him most, and the fruits of whose inspiration
we still daily reap. Jedburgh has some
claim on the Scott student and for the lover of old
romance. His best hours will be spent by its
venerable Abbey, in the most excellent of situations
(how well those old monks could gauge the
lie of the land!), girt about with well-kept gardens,

poem in Nature and Art.</p>

<p class="ppq25 p1">'Bosom'd in woods where mighty rivers run,<br />
Kelso's fair vale expands before the sun;<br />
Its rising downs in vernal beauty swell,<br />
And fringed with hazel winds each flowery dell;<br />
Green-spangled plains to dimpling lawns succeed,<br />
And Tempé rises on the banks of Tweed.<br />
Blue o'er the river Kelso's shadow lies,<br />
And copse clad isles amid the waters rise.'</p>

<p class="pn p1">There is one place which should not be overlooked.
To him who writes it is the sweetest and
the best, entwined with memories lasting as life
itself. With the story of Thomas of Ercildoune
he first heard that of Sir Walter Scott. Under
the weird shadow of the Rhymer's Tower, other
names fell upon his ear&mdash;Ashestiel, Abbotsford,
'Marmion,' 'Waverley.' Much has been since
then! But home and the days of youth are
never forgotten. One hears still in memory the
music of the Leader. Across the years comes
there again and again a sweet old-time fragrance of
yellow broom from Cowdenknowes.</p>

Some wag possibly nicknamed the place 'the Clarty Hole,'

the Earl of Haddington unveiled a marble tablet in commemoration
of the visit, when the venerable Duc de Salmonetta,
with whom Sir Walter travelled in Italy, was present and
took part in the proceedings.</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> As all the world knows, Scott stood indebted in 1826,
on the Ballantyne-Constable crash, for no less a sum than
£120,000, and a further £10,000 raised on Abbotsford with
the view of averting the disaster. He determined to give
every man his own. 'If my life is spared, nobody shall lose a
penny by me,' he said, 'and this right hand shall work it all off.'
Between 1826 and 1832 the debt was diminished by £66,000,
an average of £11,000 a year. Against the remaining
£54,000, a sum of £22,000 was received for his life insurance,
and a generous advance from Cadell enabled his executors to
settle in full with the Ballantyne creditors. By 1847 the
loan was reduced to one-half, and the mortgage on the lands
to £8,500. On May 11, 1847, Lockhart writes to Croker:
'I have finally settled all our Sir Walter's affairs. There
remained debt secured on the lands, £8,500; to Cadell,
£16,000; and sundries, £1,000. I have taken the £1,000
on myself, and Cadell obliterates the £24,500 on condition
of getting the whole remaining copyright of Scott's works,
and also of the Life.' At the time of the failure Scott
surrendered his Collection at Abbotsford to his creditors;
but so pleased were they with his fair and honourable response
to their claims that they requested him to accept the furniture,
plate, paintings, library, and museum, as a mark of
sympathy and appreciation of his conduct. He valued his
Collection at £10,000, and left it in his will to his eldest son,
burdened to the extent of £5,000, for division among his
younger children. In order to effect this, the second Sir
Walter would have been obliged to disperse the Collection
but for a subscription raised among a number of Scott's
admirers to purchase the Abbotsford Collection and hold it
in trust for the public and the family. This trust is vested
in the Dean and Council of the Faculty of Advocates, who
are empowered to leave the Collection in the charge and
keeping of Scott's representatives at Abbotsford, or, should
occasion arise, to remove it to some other building. The
copyrights purchased by Cadell in 1847 were sold in 1851 by
private bargain for £27,000 to Messrs. Adam and Charles
Black, the publishers of the present volume. Messrs. Black's
editions of Scott's works may, therefore, be trusted to contain
the exact text as left in the 'Magnum Opus,' the MSS. of
which are still in their possession.</p></div>

'pleading,' so Scott says, 'for a clansman of mine (Rob Scott),
who, having sustained an affront from two men on the road
home from Earlston Fair, nobly waylaid and murdered them
both, single-handed.' Lockhart lost his case, and his client
was hanged.</p></div>

course, borrowed from Scott's 'Paul's Letters' (see vol. ii. for
Abbotsford)&mdash;is seldom read nowadays, and there has been
no new edition for years. Still, it is a faithful, if pungent,
picture of the period, and, notwithstanding a certain ill odour,
really contains far more good than evil. There was no first
edition, the first actual publication being called the second
edition. Why, would be difficult to say.</p></div>

without an effort.'&mdash;<i>Life of Hope Scott.</i></p></div>

beauty. When George IV. came to Edinburgh, she was one
of the maids of honour at Holyrood. She was Sir Adam
Ferguson's niece, and it was he who practically arranged the
match. Following her marriage, she and her husband lived
for a time at Lochore (purchased in 1813 by her father, a
prosperous Dundee merchant). Sir Walter Scott himself was
often there. Reference is made in 'The Abbot' to Ballingry
Kirk. After 1832 Lochore was let to tenants, and in 1867
was sold for £60,000 to the Lochore Coal Company, in whose
hands it still remains.</p></div>

sensitive and reserved. She hardly ever mentioned her
husband's name after his death. She was very kind-hearted,
but rarely expressed her feelings. She was very fond of
children. She lived a quiet and retired life, interesting herself
much in politics, and could talk and argue well on the
subject. She was clever and well read. She would never
speak of Abbotsford.'</p></div>

abridged version of Lockhart, ignorant, apparently, of Lockhart's
own Abridgment. And in 1871 Hope Scott asks
leave to dedicate a reprint of it to Gladstone as 'one among
those who think that Scott still deserves to be remembered,
not as an author only, but as a noble and vigorous man.'</p></div>

affairs of Abbotsford. Literary in her leanings, quite a
number of volumes have come from her pen: 'The Making
of Abbotsford, and Incidents in Scottish History'; 'Abbotsford
and its Treasures'; 'The Tragedy of Fotheringay';
'Life of Henry Schomberg Kerr, Sailor and Jesuit'; 'Joan of
Arc,' and many articles besides, with the Prefaces to the

tower. In most books on Scott it is generally referred to as
Smailholm Tower. Smailholm, however, had another Keep
of that name (now demolished) close to the village. Many
old records and maps read Sandeknow, etc., and local usage
confirms this. Scott himself liked to speak of Sandyknowe.</p></div></div>
